&lt;p&gt;So, while ToddlerBox is riding high, I'd like to share some thoughts about another app I have in the store; &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/littlelittle/9nblggh51b1b"&gt;LittleLittle&lt;/a&gt;. This app has been the subject of most of my efforts over the last few months and is significantly more complex (and, frustratingly, less successful!) than ToddlerBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LittleLittle was started shortly after my baby girl started weaning and became constipated - apparently a very common occurrence. When we visited a paediatrician about it, they asked that we keep a record of her bowel movements so that we could track the condition to see if it was getting better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I wonder if there's an app for that", I thought. And, of course, there was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opportunity and Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while there are plenty of other baby tracking apps out there, very few work across platform (I use Windows Mobile while my partner uses Android) and even fewer work as I feel they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the requirement to work across a variety of platforms, maximising code re-use was extremely desirable. As such, I decided that all of the core-logic for the app needed to be written in a PCL. Furthermore, particular care would be taken to observe a pure MVVM methodology so that ViewModels (an embodiment of the app's UX) could also be shared across platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, following some work in the CQRS/ES space at my previous employer, I wanted to write an app that used this methodology end-to-end. LittleLittle seemed a perfect opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technology and Platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To partner the &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html"&gt;CQRS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html"&gt;ES&lt;/a&gt; methodology, I was keen to use &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh242985.aspx"&gt;Rx&lt;/a&gt; as the driving technology for implementation. As readers of my blog will know, I am very much of the opinion that "&lt;a href="http://slides.com/robwormald/everything-is-a-stream#/" title="Everything is a stream - Rob Wormald"&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754" title="The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing - andrestaltz"&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://weareadaptive.com/blog/2014/05/05/everything-is-a-stream/" title="Reactive Trader 2: Everything is a Stream - Matt Barrett"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://colintheshots.com/blog/?p=85" title="Be Reactive - Colintheshots"&gt;stream&lt;/a&gt;" and event sourcing from "a stream of events" seemed a perfect fit for Rx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the Event Sourcing methodology - not to mention the nature of the app itself - required a persistence layer, I decided to use a recently new technology; &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/"&gt;Entity Framework Core&lt;/a&gt;. I decided on EFCore simply because the tooling for the UWP platform was pretty good and I liked the 'code-first' approach to schema and migration generation. Coupled with this, I decided to use a &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/sqlite/"&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; database as it was a proven data store for use with EFCore and across a variety of underlying platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when I started LittleLittle I was studying for the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-357.aspx"&gt;Microsoft Beta Exam "Developing Mobile Apps"&lt;/a&gt;. As such, while I was keen for the app to be cross-platform, the initial platform I wanted to support was UWP. I was - and still am - amazed by how, if you craft your code and views carefully, an application can run on an amazing number for platforms including RaspberryPi, Phone, Tablet, PC, Xbox and Hololens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And here's one I made earlier…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many weeks of work, innumerable iterations and much refactoring, I ended up with this:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm extremely happy with the result. CQRS/ES and Rx are a perfect match and the technology stack in general has been extremely productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I drew up a (retrospective) architecture to illustrate how much of the application is portable and how simple yet extensible it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://bdliqq-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3mdSQ-fHhXJWrDI-4wfqFoaso56RU_vCH51ognfdTMYlml6nEgxQHUJWgTgHg5fw4cAEwpaJM1GVookE2ok4HscXXmd-a6WAcU7Xd509Rdmb35JaS2-5Zzx5G_YiNpAoxLekZifHRzDQittyVv6rybVIp33YiqopFatHZVcND-lhY?width=1024&amp;amp;height=626&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:800; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Architecture diagram"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"The proof is in the dog-fooding"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the mixed metaphors but, suffice to say, while the technology choices may be deemed to be a success, the app can only be consider to be so if it is fit for purpose. As such, I have been using LittleLittle everyday for the past several weeks - across a number of iterations and versions - and I'm very, very pleased with the result. The UI is fast and efficient to use and the app has yet to crash or lose any data (either at runtime or between versions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a little while ago my other half took our baby to stay with her grandparents for a several days and agreed to keep LittleLittle up to date while she was away. She came back with a couple of small suggestions but overall very impressed by how fast and easy to use it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it has yet to see a significant number of Windows Store acquisitions, Store Analytics shows there are a few people actively using the app and, so far, I have yet to see any crashes or failures. I intend to leverage the success of ToddlerBox to promote LittleLittle in the near future so, fingers crossed, it'll start getting some serious use and useful feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I intend to put LittleLittle on hold for a little while in order to work on some other projects I've been meaning to look at, I very much intend to return to the project early in the new year. I have a backlog full of features I'd like to implement not to mention the need to write a version which runs on Android/iOS (which will probably be in Xamarin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I will be blogging about a few of the components in the architecture diagram above and sharing some of the approaches I have taken and successes (or problems!) I encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>WebRx and Typescript</title>
		<updated>2016-03-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>
                                        


&lt;h1&gt;Continuing with WebRx&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="./posts/RxWeb"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; of this series I showed how to set up a project structure that allows you to start using WebRx from within Visual Studio. While fairly simple, the example provides a great illustration of you how WebRx allows you to separate your view and view model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I further develop the structure to allow you to develop your application using Typescript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;From 'app.js' to 'app.ts'&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously we copied a chunk of JavaScript from the WebRx &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;getting started guide&lt;/a&gt; into an &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; script that was directly used from within the &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file. We now want to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler"&gt;&lt;em&gt;transpile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; script from a Typescript file so that we can further develop the application in a structured and type-safe manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this simply follow the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete the existing &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; file leaving the &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; folder empty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add and configure a &lt;code&gt;TypeScript JSON Configuration File&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;TypeScript JSON Configuration File&lt;/code&gt; to the solution as shown below&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWebWithTypescript/AddTypeScriptJsonConfigurationFile.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Add TypeScript Json Configuration File"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; exclusion with &lt;code&gt;Scripts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By default Visual Studio (or, more acurately, the TypeScript transpiler) with pick up all &lt;code&gt;ts&lt;/code&gt; files in the solution. As we don't want to attempt to re-transpile all the referenced typescript files we add &lt;code&gt;Scripts&lt;/code&gt; to the exclusion list. Further, as we added a reference to &lt;code&gt;WebRx&lt;/code&gt; via Nuget, our references are in the &lt;code&gt;Scripts&lt;/code&gt; folder, not &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;, so this exclusion can be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an &lt;code&gt;outDir&lt;/code&gt; setting to transpile to the &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; folder&lt;br&gt;
This setting will force the TypeScript transpiler to output the transpiled JavaScript files to the &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; folder where they can be used by the client browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should now have a &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; file that looks like this:
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "noEmitOnError": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "es5",
    "outDir": "js"
  },
  "exclude": [
    "Scripts",
    "wwwroot"
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;ts&lt;/code&gt; folder to the solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an &lt;code&gt;app.ts&lt;/code&gt; typescript file to the &lt;code&gt;ts&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add references to Rx and WebRx to the &lt;code&gt;app.ts&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
WebRx requires that you add an explicit reference to &lt;code&gt;rx.all.d.ts&lt;/code&gt; prior to the reference to &lt;code&gt;web.rx.d.ts&lt;/code&gt; in order for the Rx module to be brought into scope. The references should therefore be added like this:
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// &amp;lt;reference path="../Scripts/rx.all.d.ts"/&amp;gt;
/// &amp;lt;reference path="../Scripts/typings/web.rx.d.ts" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement view / view model code&lt;br&gt;
You can now re-implement the code from &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; as TypeScript virtually verbatim but do note how you get Intellisense for all the methods and properties of &lt;code&gt;wx&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix compilation error with call to &lt;code&gt;wx.applyBindings&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;wx.applyBindings&lt;/code&gt; method &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;code&gt;model&lt;/code&gt; parameter which, in JavaScript, is defaulted but in TypeScript causes a compilation error. To resolve this, simply pass an empty object to the method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;app.ts&lt;/code&gt; file should now look like this:
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// &amp;lt;reference path="../Scripts/rx.all.d.ts"/&amp;gt;
/// &amp;lt;reference path="../Scripts/typings/web.rx.d.ts" /&amp;gt;

wx.app.component('hello', {
    viewModel: function () {
        this.firstName = 'Bart';
        this.lastName = 'Simpson';
    },
    template: 'The name is &amp;lt;span data-bind="text: firstName + \' \' + lastName"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;'
});

wx.router.state({
    name: "$",
    views: { 'main': "hello" }
});

wx.router.reload();

wx.applyBindings({});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile the project and include the generated &lt;code&gt;js/app.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;js/app.js.map&lt;/code&gt; files into the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit F5 and you should again see the message 'The name is Bart Simpson' displayed in your default browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you're now ready to develop your application using full Intellisense and in the comfort of the knowledge that the compiler (well, transpiler) will pick up any syntactic bugs you may inadvertently create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the completed &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/BlogProjects/tree/master/WebRxWithTypeScript"&gt;source code for this post&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/BlogProjects"&gt;BlogProjects repository&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last post, I used the Logstash &lt;code&gt;dns&lt;/code&gt; filter to translate remote server IP addresses into recognisable domain names. In this post, I will look to perform a similar operation for local IP addresses in order to translate them into recognisable device names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;translating local ip addresses to device names&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the last post we could use the &lt;code&gt;dns&lt;/code&gt; filter to perform a reverse dns lookup to resolve a remote domain name for an IP address, this is not possible with local IP addresses. Fortunately, I have two key tools that I can use to perform a similar operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While my router behaves as a DHCP server, it has a feature that allows it to always allocate the same IP address to a given MAC address. Therefore I know a given device will always have a specific IP address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logstash provides the &lt;code&gt;translate&lt;/code&gt; filter which allows you to map from one value to another via a dictionary lookup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my routers "Bind IP to MAC" function set up, I will author a new &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; file that meets the specifications outlined in the &lt;code&gt;translate&lt;/code&gt; filter &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-translate.html#plugins-filters-translate-destination"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.1.3: TPLink Range Extender
192.168.1.9: Ricoh Printer
192.168.1.10: Server A
192.168.1.21: PC A
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll name this file &lt;code&gt;IPLookup.yaml&lt;/code&gt; and save it besides the &lt;code&gt;syslog.config&lt;/code&gt; file. Next I need to add additional filters to &lt;code&gt;syslog.config&lt;/code&gt; which now looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;input {
  tcp {
    port =&amp;gt; 5000
    type =&amp;gt; syslog
  }
  udp {
    port =&amp;gt; 5000
    type =&amp;gt; syslog
  }
}

filter {
    grok {
        match =&amp;gt; [ "message", "&amp;lt;%{POSINT:syslog_pri}&amp;gt;%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp} Vigor\: Local User \(MAC=%{MAC:source_mac}\): %{IP:source_address}(?::%{POSINT:source_port})? -&amp;gt; %{IP:destination_address}(?::%{POSINT:destination_port})? \((?&amp;lt;protocol&amp;gt;TCP|UDP)\)" ]
        add_tag =&amp;gt; "access"
    }
    if "access" in [tags] {
        mutate {
            add_field =&amp;gt; {
              "source_host" =&amp;gt; "%{[source_address]}"
              "destination_host" =&amp;gt; "%{[destination_address]}"
            }
        }
        dns {
            reverse =&amp;gt; [ "destination_host" ]
            action =&amp;gt; "replace"
            nameserver =&amp;gt; "192.168.1.1"
        }
        translate {
            destination =&amp;gt; "source_host"
            dictionary_path =&amp;gt; "config\IPLookup.yaml"
            fallback =&amp;gt; "%{source_address}"
            field =&amp;gt; "source_address"      
            override =&amp;gt; true   
        }
    }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts =&amp;gt; ["192.168.1.30:9200"]
    index =&amp;gt; "syslog-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the &lt;code&gt;translate&lt;/code&gt; filter where I lookup the &lt;code&gt;source_address&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;code&gt;IPLookup.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file and put the result in the &lt;code&gt;source_host&lt;/code&gt; field. If not found, the &lt;code&gt;fallback&lt;/code&gt; value instructs the filter to output the &lt;code&gt;source_address&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;source_host&lt;/code&gt; field. The &lt;code&gt;override&lt;/code&gt; value is set to true as the &lt;code&gt;source_host&lt;/code&gt; field is added in the &lt;code&gt;mutate&lt;/code&gt; filter above as a fail-safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the changes to configuration in place, I once again restart Logstash. Once a syslog message has been received, I get the mapping from ElasticSearch and update it to mark the &lt;code&gt;local_host&lt;/code&gt; field as &lt;code&gt;not_analyzed&lt;/code&gt;. Then, in Kibana, I refresh the field list for the 'syslog-*' index, add 'local_host' to the 'Syslog Messages' saved search, load 'Access By Local Address' visualization and modify it to use 'local_host' rather than the 'local_address' field and save it as 'Access By Local Host'. Finally, I replace this visualization on my dashboard and get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-DashboardWithAccessByLocalHost.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Dashboard With Access By Local Host"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;further mappings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I've got the translation of local IP addresses to names working, I'm going to add a few more translations for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP Address to Operating System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP Address to Wired/WiFi connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TCP and UDP Port to Protocol (using a &lt;a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml"&gt;CSV from IANA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these in place, the dashboard is starting to come together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-DashboardWithLocalPortAndOsLookups.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Dashboard With Local Port And Os Lookups"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I showed how to display local device names rather than IP addresses by using LogStash's &lt;code&gt;translate&lt;/code&gt; filter. I then used this filter to provide further information about local device and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, I'll show how to add some variation to the dashboard by mapping destination locations.&lt;/p&gt;



                                </content>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;In the last post, I used the Logstash &lt;code&gt;dns&lt;/code&gt; filter to translate remote server IP addresses into recognisable domain names. In this post, I will look to perform a similar operation for local IP addresses in order to translate them into recognisable device names.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;If you're starting out with &lt;a href="http://docs.geteventstore.com/introduction/event-sourcing-basics/" title="Event Sourcing Basics at GetEventStore"&gt;Event Sourcing&lt;/a&gt; you're probably looking for the ability to project events into &lt;a href="http://cqrs.nu/tutorial/cs/03-read-models" title="CQRS tutorial - Read Models"&gt;read models&lt;/a&gt; that can be used by the views in your application. Today I'd like to share a neat little mechanism I've established for building read model in C# by employing a strongly typed yet functional approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with infrastructure, you probably have some form event distribution mechanism, normally a pub/sub style bus. From this bus you need to be able to selectively subscribe to all the events you need to collate the information required by your read model. Furthermore, you will often need to initialize the read model with information from a persistent store - often this is a persistent store of the read model itself but this isn't necessarily the case. Lastly, your application must be able to request a specific read model and receive notifications when the read model changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate how this might be achieved, I have written a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/Blog.ReactiveReadModels" title="ReactiveReadModels repository on Github"&gt;small sample project&lt;/a&gt; following the traditional Account/Order model that features the following components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/posts/ReactiveReadModels-SampleComponents.png" alt="Sample Components" class="img-responsive" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this system, the application is able to request a stream of read models from a repository. The repository will retrieve initial read model state from a persistence service and then subscribe to events from an event bus to continually update and publish the read model. Only read models the application needs should be published and only events the read model requires should be processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging Rx we're able to implement a stub of the repository very easily as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class Repository
{
    private readonly Service.IAccountService _accountService;
    private readonly IEventAggregator _bus;

    public Repository(Service.IAccountService accountService, IEventAggregator bus)
    {
        _accountService = accountService;
        _bus = bus;
    }

    public IObservable&amp;lt;ReadModel&amp;gt; For(Guid id)
    {
        if (id == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("id");

        return Observable.Create&amp;lt;ReadModel&amp;gt;(
            async observer =&amp;gt;
            {
                Service.AccountInfo accountInfo = await _accountService.GetAccountInfoAsync(id);

                ReadModel readModel = accountInfo.ToReadModel();

                // Subscribe to events and apply to read model

                return Observable.StartWith(readModel).Subscribe(observer);
            }
        );
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code is written such that, when an observer &lt;em&gt;subscribes&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;IObservable&amp;lt;ReadModel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; returned from the &lt;code&gt;For&lt;/code&gt; method, an asynchronous request will be made to the &lt;code&gt;IAccountService&lt;/code&gt; for the initial state of the read model, a &lt;code&gt;ReadModel&lt;/code&gt; instance will be constructed from the information returned by the  service and finally the &lt;code&gt;ReadModel&lt;/code&gt; will be emitted to the subscriber. Note that the observable is deliberately left incomplete to indicate the further &lt;code&gt;ReadModel&lt;/code&gt; instances might be emitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have the current read model, we need to subscribe to events from the event bus that represent changes pertinent to the read model and, when received, modify and emit the read model so that the subscriber is always up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, we might think to write something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public IObservable&amp;lt;ReadModel&amp;gt; For(Guid id)
{
    if (id == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("id");

    return Observable.Create&amp;lt;ReadModel&amp;gt;(
        async observer =&amp;gt;
        {
            Service.AccountInfo accountInfo = await _accountService.GetAccountInfoAsync(id);

            ReadModel readModel = accountInfo.ToReadModel();

            return new CompositeDisposable(
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.AccountNameChanged&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Select(@@event =&amp;gt; readModel.WithAccountName(@@event.AccountName)).Subscribe(observer),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.AddBillingAddress&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Select(@@event =&amp;gt; readModel.WithBillingAddress(new Address(@@event.AddressName))).Subscribe(observer),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.RemoveBillingAddress&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Select(@@event =&amp;gt; readModel.WithoutBillingAddress(@@event.AddressName)).Subscribe(observer),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.OrderInvoiced&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Select(@@event =&amp;gt; readModel.WithCurrentOrder(new Order(@@event.OrderId))).Subscribe(observer),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.OrderDispatched&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Select(@@event =&amp;gt; readModel.WithCompletedOrder(@@event.OrderId)).Subscribe(observer)
            );
        }
    );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this code looks sensible, we'll very quickly run into problems with it. Firstly and primarily each subscription is only ever modifying the initial &lt;code&gt;readModel&lt;/code&gt; instance meaning changes are not cumulative. Secondly, if we somehow overcame the initial issue, because we're maintaining a series of subscriptions here, changes are not thread safe nor deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, what we need is a way of writing the effect of these changes into a common read model instance, aggregating those changes across multiple events and emitting the new read model each time it is updated. Fortunately, Rx has &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; the operator we need for this: &lt;code&gt;IObservable&amp;lt;TAccumulate&amp;gt; Scan&amp;lt;TSource, TAccumulate&amp;gt;(this IObservable&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt; source, TAccumulate seed, Func&amp;lt;TAccumulate, TSource, TAccumulate&amp;gt; accumulator)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This operator takes an initial &lt;code&gt;TAccumulate&lt;/code&gt; seed and applies each item emitted from the &lt;code&gt;IObservable&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; source to the accumulator by invoking a function that takes the current accumulator value and the emitted item and returning a new accumulator value. Each of these new accumulator values are then emitted as an &lt;code&gt;IObservable&amp;lt;TAccumulate&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instances to the subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, so it's pretty obvious here that our accumulator should be our read model, but how do we subscribe to all the different message types and apply a different modifications to the read model for each type of  message received when the &lt;code&gt;Scan&lt;/code&gt; function only allows for a single &lt;code&gt;TSource&lt;/code&gt; type. We need to somehow homogenise the source stream to a single type. Often this is done with inheritance but, as there's no common base type for each of these messages, we'd have to write something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public IObservable&amp;lt;ReadModel&amp;gt; For(Guid id)
{
    if (id == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("id");

    return Observable.Create&amp;lt;ReadModel&amp;gt;(
        async observer =&amp;gt;
        {
            Service.AccountInfo accountInfo = await _accountService.GetAccountInfoAsync(id);

            ReadModel readModel = accountInfo.ToReadModel();

            IObservable&amp;lt;object&amp;gt; events = Observable.Merge(
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.AccountNameChanged&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Cast&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;(),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.AddBillingAddress&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Cast&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;(),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.RemoveBillingAddress&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Cast&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;(),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.OrderInvoiced&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Cast&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;(),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.OrderDispatched&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Cast&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;()
            );

            return events.Scan(readModel,
                (readModel, @@event) =&amp;gt;
                {
                    if (@@event is Event.AccountNameChanged)
                    {
                        return readModel.WithAccountName(((Event.AccountNameChanged)@@event).AccountName);
                    }
                    else if (@@event is Event.AddBillingAddress)
                    {
                        ...
                    }
                    ...
                    else
                    {
                        throw new ArgumentException("Unknown message type");
                    }
                }
            );
        }
    );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... which is not type safe, has very little compile time checking, requires a fall-through exception and, quite frankly, is horrible. I'm sure with Rx we can do something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, lets look at this from a functional perspective. The action we want to perform when receiving each type of event can be considered to be a function in the form of &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;TReadModel, TEvent, TReadModel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This is very similar to the third parameter of the &lt;code&gt;Observable.Scan&lt;/code&gt; function with the problem being that we have multiple types of &lt;code&gt;TEvent&lt;/code&gt;. If only there was a way to produce a generic function that would operate correctly across all the event types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, by leaning on a concept from functional languages, this might be possible. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application" title="Partial Application definition from wikipedia"&gt;Partial application&lt;/a&gt; has been available in C# - via &lt;a href="http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Chapter5/Closures.aspx" title="C# in Depth - The Beauty Of Closures"&gt;closures&lt;/a&gt; - since lambdas were introduced and allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fix a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity. Given a function f:(X * Y * Z) -&amp;gt; N , we might fix (or 'bind') the first argument, producing a function of type (f){partial}:(Y * Z) -&amp;gt; N . Evaluation of this function might be represented as f{partial}(2, 3). Note that the result of partial function application in this case is a function that takes two arguments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is there some way we can leverage this to remove the &lt;code&gt;TEvent&lt;/code&gt; argument from the function? Absolutely, by making the observable emit a &lt;em&gt;stream of partial functions&lt;/em&gt; in the form &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;ReadModel,ReadModel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which can then be applied to the read model as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public IObservable&amp;lt;ReadModel&amp;gt; For(Guid id)
{
    if (id == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("id");

    return Observable.Create&amp;lt;ReadModel&amp;gt;(
        async observer =&amp;gt;
        {
            Service.AccountInfo accountInfo = await _accountService.GetAccountInfoAsync(id);

            IObservable&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;ReadModel, ReadModel&amp;gt;&amp;gt; mutators = Observable.Merge(
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.AccountNameChanged&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Select(Functions.Apply),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.AddBillingAddress&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Select(Functions.Apply),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.RemoveBillingAddress&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Select(Functions.Apply),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.OrderInvoiced&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Select(Functions.Apply),
                _bus.GetEvent&amp;lt;Event.OrderDispatched&amp;gt;().Where(@@event =&amp;gt; id.Equals(@@event.AccountId)).Select(Functions.Apply)
            );

            return mutators.Scan(accountInfo.ToReadModel(), (readModel, mutator) =&amp;gt; mutator(readModel)).Subscribe(observer);
        }
    );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the &lt;code&gt;Functions.Apply&lt;/code&gt; is an overloaded method for each of the event types. For example, the method for &lt;code&gt;Event.AccountNameChanged&lt;/code&gt; is implemented as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static Func&amp;lt;ReadModel, ReadModel&amp;gt; Apply(Event.AccountNameChanged @@event)
{
    return readModel =&amp;gt; readModel.WithAccountName(@@event.AccountName);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method takes the event to be processed as a parameter and returns a function in the form &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;ReadModel,ReadModel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that closes over the parameter and calls the &lt;code&gt;WithAccountName&lt;/code&gt; extension method when executed. A similar pattern is followed for all the other event types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have projected and merged all the event streams into a single &lt;code&gt;IObservable&amp;lt;Func&amp;lt;ReadModel, ReadModel&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; we can use the scan function to iteratively apply each function to the cumulative read model instance and emit the result after each event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty neat huh!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The absolute easiest way to use SVG icons in UWP apps</title>
		<updated>2016-09-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>
                                        


&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3528493/628821"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22107360/628821"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.u2u.be/diederik/post/2012/07/26/Transforming-SVG-graphics-to-XAML-Metro-Icons.aspx"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;) ways to use SVG assets as icons in UWP / XAML apps, most requiring some form of DataTemplate or UserControl. While these approaches work &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt; they're normally a pain to author and use, often requiring custom converters to be written if the asset is to be used via any form of data binding. Here I present an extremely flexible way of using these assets that requires nothing more than drag-and-drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach uses &lt;a href="https://glyphter.com/"&gt;Glyphter&lt;/a&gt; - a free, online tool for converting SVG icons to fonts - to produce a custom font containing your SVG assets; similar to fonts like &lt;a href="http://modernicons.io/segoe-mdl2/cheatsheet/"&gt;Segoe MDL2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://fontawesome.io/"&gt;FontAwesome&lt;/a&gt;. Glypter's free tier allows you to craft a single font, containing just basic alpha-numerics. Should you need more than this, you can upgrade to a premium tier which allows you to work on multiple fonts of a much greater size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've built your font, it can be embedded in the app package and icons displayed by simply using a TextBlock element with the Text property set to the alpha-numeric code of the icon to display and the FontFamily set to the custom font. Furthermore, you're easily able to present the required icons in the desired colour - by changing the TextBlock's Foreground brush - and size - by changing FontSize or embedding within the TextBlock within a ViewBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, simply locating the SVG asset you'd like to use. &lt;a href="https://thenounproject.com/"&gt;The Noun Project&lt;/a&gt; is a good resource containing an incredible number of high quality icons that can be used in commercial products for a small fee or via attribution. Once you've found the icon you want to use - lets use &lt;a href="https://thenounproject.com/localdomain/collection/memes/?oq=meme&amp;amp;cidx=0&amp;amp;i=105269"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://thenounproject.com/localdomain/"&gt;Gareth&lt;/a&gt; - simply download the icon as an SVG. Once it's downloaded, locate the file and drag it onto the Glypter grid in the desired location. After a short pause while the file is uploaded to Glypter and processed, it'll appear in the grid slot you selected; here I've added the icon to the 'A':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/UsingSVGInUWP/DraggedIntoGlyphter.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Glyphter custom font"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat this for all the icons you want to use - I'll just stick with the one icon for now - then download the font by clicking the font download button (the 'down arrow' in the 'FONT' button). This will compile all your assets into a zip file containing the font (in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType"&gt;'.ttf'&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format"&gt;'.woff'&lt;/a&gt; formats), svg and css assets. We're only interested in the '.ttf' file so extract it from the zip file and copy it to the 'Assets' folder of your UWP app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From within VisualStudio - or better yet, Blend - add the '.ttf' file to the project, ensuring it's 'Build Action' is set to 'Content' and 'Copy to Output Directory' set to 'Do not copy' as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/UsingSVGInUWP/BlendWithGlyphterFont.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Custom font added to project in Blend"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in place, when you drop a TextBlock on a page, you should be able to select your embedded font from the Font combobox as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/UsingSVGInUWP/SelectFont.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Custom font selection in Blend"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest, as they say, is history. In a few minutes you too can use the following XAML:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Grid&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;StackPanel HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;TextBlock Text="SVG in UWP EZ!" HorizontalAlignment="Center" FontFamily="Impact" Margin="10"/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;TextBlock Text="A" FontFamily="ms-appx:/Assets/Glyphter.ttf#Glyphter" FontSize="96" HorizontalAlignment="Center"/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;TextBlock Text="Y U NO USE!" HorizontalAlignment="Center" FontFamily="Impact"/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/StackPanel&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Grid&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: There seems to be an issue/inconsistency with the FontFamily value created when using the XAML designer to select your custom font. Sometimes, but not always, the designer will fail to add the "ms-appx" protocol to the FontFamily property value which, while it has no effect at design time, will prevent the app from locating the custom font at runtime. You should there ensure this value is present before deploying your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create this amazing UI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/UsingSVGInUWP/SVGInUWPEZ.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="SVG in UWP EZ! Y U NO USE!"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

While these approaches work &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt; they're normally a pain to author and use, often requiring custom converters to be written if the asset is to be used via any form of data binding. Here I present an extremely flexible way of using these assets that requires nothing more than drag-and-drop.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;From a youth of misspent money, I have a moderately large DVD collection. Some 600 movies in half a dozen DVD racks take a disproportionately large space in my dining room. This year, my partner and I  decided to host Xmas dinner for the family, meaning a dining table that could host a dozen was in order and... well, you can see where this is heading. The DVDs had to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, even though I barely watch them anymore, there are still a couple of amazing films in my collection that aren't available from the (far too changeable) online streaming services and, as such, I was reluctant to simply banish them all to the attic. Instead, I decided to undertake the monumental task of ripping them all to HDD before boxing them all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are innumerable software solutions for ripping and transcoding DVD's... if you want to do one at a time. As you can probably appreciate, this wasn't a possibility for me or I'd still be ripping discs well into the New Year (not to mention through the Xmas dinner I'm actually doing this for). So a more, 'roll-your-own' solution was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of googling revealed &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/autorip-rips-dvds-and-blu-rays-as-soon-as-you-insert-th-477274988"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; which described a mechanism for ripping discs as soon as you put them into the drive. While it was still targetting people who wanted to rip discs one at a time, it did point me towards the two pieces of software I did ultimately use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.makemkv.com/"&gt;MakeMKV&lt;/a&gt; - for ripping the entire contents of the DVD and,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://handbrake.fr/"&gt;Handbrake&lt;/a&gt; - for transcoding source files into compressed H.264 format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these utilities come with CLI interfaces (details &lt;a href="http://www.makemkv.com/developers/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/cli/cli-options.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; respectively) allowing them to be automated. Furthermore, MakeMKV can run multiple instances allowing you to do your drive ripping (the long slow process) in parallel from multiple drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd been intending to buy a new server for my home to be used as a Docker host because my current server is so old it simply doesn't support the required virtualization instructions. I'd had my eye on the &lt;a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/714837-dell-poweredge-t20-3708-xeon-e3-1225v3-3-2-ghz-4gb-ram-1tb-hdd-tower-t20-3708"&gt;Dell T20 Xeon E3&lt;/a&gt; but was waiting for it to drop back below the £200 (after cashback) mark. However, realising I could (temporarily) use it as a DVD ripping machine, I decided to bite the bullet and bought the T20 with an additional 4Gb of RAM for £324 (less 2% Quidco and £80 cashback).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It arrived a couple of days later and I must say I'm impressed. It's a lot of machine for the money, well built, has a copious number of USB sockets and is surprisingly fast. I installed Windows Server 2016 on this as it's the OS I intend to use for the Docker host and I thought it'd be a good practice run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this I added the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 x 1Tb internal HDDs - configured as RAID-0 providing a fast destination for the drive rips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 x USB DVD-ROM drives - drives for ripping from - a couple I already had plus a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01B8U7JW2/ref=pe_385721_51767431_TE_dp_1"&gt;couple from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 x 4Tb external USB HDD - destination for transcoded rips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in, it's quite a monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Putting it together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most of the out of the box software I'd found, I needed software that would do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for a disc to be inserted in one of the drives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine that the disc is actually a DVD video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rip the disc to a destination folder based on the volume label of the DVD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow up to four concurrent rip operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queue ripped folders for transcoding allowing only a single transcoding operation to run at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the transcoded movie to the external drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there may be software out there that does this, a couple of evening's googling didn't reveal it so, I decided a DIY job was in order. Besides, I thought the multiple producer/single consumer nature of the multiple rips/single transcoding would be a great fit for playing with &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh228603%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?f=255&amp;amp;MSPPError=-2147217396"&gt;Dataflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In relatively short order, I created &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/DriveRipper"&gt;DriveRipper&lt;/a&gt;... and it's worked pretty well. I've been happily ripping four DVD's at a time, averaging around 12-15 DVD's an hour, with only a few small problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because Dataflow enforces order of tasks throughout the pipeline (one if it's biggest strengths!) a slow rip or drive can hold up transcoding such that a queue builds up. Not a massive problem as the encoding process on the Xeon is actually pretty rapid (averaging 450fps) so it catches up with the relatively slow ripping process (about 20 minutes per disc) with ease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some DVD's - particularly the old ones - are single sided or low quality or lack additional material or all of the above. This means that the contents of the disc is less than the 4.2Gb cut off I used for determining that a particular disc is likely to be a DVD. This can be sorted with a simple code change but I dediced to put these discs to one side for now and come back to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some DVD's - again, particularly the olds ones - don't have a rational volume name; using terms like 'e19245' or, even worse, 'DVDVideo'. This has meant that, after the transcoding is complete, I need to rename the folders so that the contents don't get overwritten by a subsequent rip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I'm 150 DVD's through and just been told that the new dining room furniture is being delivered Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rip little machine, rip like wind!! Oh, wait...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Year In Review</title>

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, having realized that we had no commitments or prior engagements until the following Tuesday, my partner and I decided to go on a trip. We rapidly packed bags for ourselves and our little girl, threw them in the van and set off with no set destination other than "the south-west". We ended up staying in a small farm on Exmoor and having a terrific time walking on the moor and visiting nearby sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other than the liberty of being able to just "get away", this weekend was notable as the previous week marked exactly one year since I left full-time employment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in July, following an epic road-trip around Europe with my girls, I wrote &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/WotNoBlogPosts"&gt;a long blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the trip and my plans for the future. These plans centred on taking the rest of the year off as a career-break and using this time to support my family while investigating/evaluating emerging technologies in the .NET ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, six months on, it's time to look back over the last year and perform a retrospective; what went well, what could have been better and what should be changed moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This is a long, detailed post with a lot of information/reflection about the previous year. As such I have published it as a MVP (Minimal Viable Post) and will iterate additional information into the post in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To aid the retrospective process, I spent last week learning &lt;a href="https://www.dartlang.org/"&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.pixijs.com/"&gt;Pixi.js&lt;/a&gt; in order to create a timeline visualization of the year. I'm not going to go into the process of making this visualization here as I want to focus on the retrospective, however I will be writing a "making of" follow-up post as the process was both very interesting and thoroughly enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below you can see the visualization; a timeline covering the entirity of last year and showing the various aspects of my behaviour / productivity on a day-by-day basis. In order to fit into the horizontal space available in most browsers/platforms, the timeline is scaled-down along the horizontal axis. As this obscures much of the data, the timeline was designed to allow you to use your mouse or finger to interactively zoom in and and pan across the it. Give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following sections I will discuss the various datasets displayed along with a summary of what they represent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script defer="" src="../Content/Scripts/timeline.dart.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div id="timeline"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This timeline represents my primary oocupation at any given time. From a high-level, last year can be broadly split into two halves, travelling for the first half and working for the latter. However, the detail is more telling so the timeline has been further split into seven disctinct states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Starlizard Consulting Ltd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last day at Starlizard Consulting Ltd was Friday 15th January, 2016. I had worked for Starlizard for over four years and very much enjoyed my time there. Unfortunately an &lt;a href="http://www.daedtech.com/top-heavy-department-growth/"&gt;internal power struggle&lt;/a&gt; resulted in a change of senior management and a return to regressive development policies which signalled that it was time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sabatical&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered the couple of months following my departure from StarLizard as a sabatical; time to reflect, get my affairs in order and spend time with my young family before  considering how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time my daughter was just 4 months old so this presented a great opportunity to support my partner and engage with my baby. Having also taken 6 weeks of &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/overview"&gt;Shared Parental Leave&lt;/a&gt; the previous year, this meant that, of her first six months of life, I'd been able to spend almost four with her. I feel incredibly fortunate to be in a situation where this is could be the case. The first few months of a baby's life are incredibly tough for both the parents and the baby and I'm very happy that I was able to be with my girls throughout this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was towards the end of this period that my partner and I decided to capitalise on our unique situation and put the remainder of her maternity leave to use by taking our little girl on a road-trip around Europe. The implications of this decision were to dominate and, to a large degree, consume the entirity of the next three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made the decision to spend a significant amount of time touring Europe, with an 8 month old baby no less, it became apparent that there would be a whole lot of preparation required to make this happen. In March we decided to buy a Nissan Elgrand E51 Rider Autech (shown below) and April onwards was spent preparing it for our trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://zdfcta-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3mRDVqstf6XsjN73biGoYnN5s-SzVcHx9pEdYl2S_wM803HpiosWK5Skxm-kskeHTMkahk_PIdejAp70x14KCaOwmZb6OvAvAig8uqI4bdBs2Pb_lAUsm-O_2lO8krW_18ReDVMLXqVkJWUGUSJ-d80bOIi8ciWIgyxDzL5fw4qF4?width=1796&amp;amp;height=1347&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:800; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Nissan Elgrand E51 Rider Autech"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This preparation was complex, with numerous requirements, constraints and learning curves across a variety of disciplines... but also a whole lot of fun. On our return I wrote a &lt;a href="http://elgrandoc.uk/forum/index.php?threads/touring-europe-in-an-elgrand-part-i-to-v.3311"&gt;very long post&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="http://elgrandoc.uk/forum/index.php"&gt;Elgrand Owners Club&lt;/a&gt; which detailed all the work I had done on the van. While the post took a significant amount of time to write, the forums were invaluable in providing the information I needed to do the work in the first place so I thought it was worth investing this time in case the post helped someone else in the same manner. To this day, the post is still one of the most viewed and commented on posts in the forum. It's well worth a read a read if you have time; if not, here are some pictures of the work instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time I learned a lot about carpentry, electronics and engineering... but I almost didn't. Prior to undertaking the work, I had looked to find a conversion specialist who would do the work for me but most either only provided pattern-part conversions or were too busy to undertake a bespoke project. Well, "necessity being the mother of invention", I set to it and, in retrospect, am extremely glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite barely having used an electric drill previously and never having dabbled in 240v electronics, I enjoyed every aspect of the work and am immensely proud of it. We didn't experience a single issue with my work while we were away and, even if we had, it was extremely comforting knowing that I could have resolved the issue in the field if I'd had to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should a similar challenge ever present itself again, I would certainly look at taking it on and, furthermore, would encourage others to do so also as you undoubtedly &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/if-youre-not-outside-your-comfort-zone-you-wont-learn-anything"&gt;learn a lot more when working outside of your comfort zone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Touring Europe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the prep done - well, as much as was possible in the time available - we left home on May 20th and didn't return again until July 17; totaling just over 8 weeks on the road. In this time we traveled &lt;strong&gt;in excess of 8000 miles and visited 22 countries&lt;/strong&gt; seeing numerous friends en-route and making many more in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was all the prep or perhaps we were just lucky but the trip went off without a hitch and everyone - including our little girl - had an amazing time. Both &lt;a href="https://bigspune.wordpress.com/"&gt;my partner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/WotNoBlogPosts"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; blogged about the trip - for ourselves as much for any potential reader - and, six months on, are still reflecting on what a fantastic adventure it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shadow of a doubt, and even when considering the week's of preparation before leaving, this trip was time well spent. My partner and I learned a lot about each other ("hey, we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; spend several weeks in a confined space together, 24/7") and our daughter and have accumulated memories that will last a lifetime. We have already talked about doing another similar trip in the future and have begun planning shorter breaks around the UK as a stop-gap until an opportunity for a new adventure comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon my return, I came across a code for a free &lt;a href="https://borntolearn.mslearn.net/b/weblog/posts/sign-up-to-take-the-beta-exam-for-developing-mobile-apps-70-357-today"&gt;Microsoft beta exam about mobile application development&lt;/a&gt;. As I was interested in UWP app development and had already taken loads of these beta exams in previous years, I decided to sit the exam even though the code was only valid for a few weeks after signing up, which left very little time to study!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning"&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bdb/17/1/1.pdf&amp;amp;productCode=pa"&gt;best&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/you-learn-by-doing-and-by-falling-over"&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2015/04/29/learning-doing-helps-students-perform-better-science"&gt;doing&lt;/a&gt; my study focused on writing a UWP app that incorporated as many of the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-357.aspx"&gt;examined technical aspects&lt;/a&gt; as possible. While the methodologies I used for this app were relatively new (i.e. CQRS/ES) the learning curve for this exam really came from some of the unique aspects of UWP app development such as designing for multiple devices/screen sizes, using &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/"&gt;new persistence technologies&lt;/a&gt; and leveraging the huge new API surface available to UWP apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to an awful dashboard implementation which &lt;a href="https://borntolearn.mslearn.net/b/weblog/posts/more-tips-about-beta-exams-what-to-expect-when-you-39-re-expecting-your-beta-results-that-is"&gt;causes much confusion for students who sit beta exams&lt;/a&gt;, I am still unsure as to whether I passed this exam or not. My dashboard has not changed to say I have passed the exam but I have not received a summary sheet from Microsoft with my scores nor am I able to access them from my MCP dashboard. In short, the current beta exam process is extremely poor and much worse than it was five or six years ago when I took (and passed) around a dozen such beta exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, time spent on this study was a huge win. I learned a lot about a platform which is becoming increasingly prevalent in the Windows ecosystem. UWP apps are able to run on everything from Raspberry Pi to Hololens, and I have since deployed/released UWP apps for Raspberry Pi, Mobile (phone/table), PC and XBox. Indeed, after completing the exam, I continued to develop my UWP study app over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Holiday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the year, I allocated around 40 days (including bank-holidays and weekends) as non-work days (aka holiday). This included snowboarding with friends, trips abroad, visiting relatives and a long festive break over Xmas. Although more than the holiday allowance at most full time jobs (depending on how it's allocated), I feel this represents a fairly decent split between work and play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;OneCog.Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once life had returned to normal following our tour of Europe and taking the Microsoft beta exam, I decided to work on a few projects that were interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this was continuing my investigation of UWP, initially to &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/CqrsEsMvvmRxEfSqlUwpPcl"&gt;flesh out&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/littlelittle/9nblggh51b1b"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; the UWP app I had written while studying for the UWP exam but then to also evaluate UWP as a &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/MonsterPi"&gt;platform for IoT devices&lt;/a&gt;. I then proceeded to broaden my area of investigation into &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/DockerAndKafka"&gt;non-Microsoft technologies&lt;/a&gt; and even into areas that, while still technical, were &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/3DPrintingWithTheCelRobox"&gt;not directly involved with software development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time I endeavored to keep an up-to-date public profile. Through a &lt;a href="https://trello.com/b/KoTWuFUi/public-board"&gt;public Trello board&lt;/a&gt;, products I had released (&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/littlelittle/9nblggh51b1b"&gt;LittleLittle&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/toddlerbox/9nblggh3zr4l"&gt;ToddlerBox&lt;/a&gt;), posts to &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; and contributions to both &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/628821/ibebbs"&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; I tried to make sure as much of my time as possible was surfaced publicly. Indeed, having become extremely delivery-oriented since first drinking the agile (&lt;a href="https://medium.com/swlh/agile-is-the-new-waterfall-f7baef5d026d#.jpmks6gi4"&gt;lower-case 'a'&lt;/a&gt;) kool-aid several years ago, I feel the public-facing nature of these interactions substituted as a form of delivery; or, in Agile parlance, became my &lt;a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-done/"&gt;"definition of done"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, in retrospect, I had hoped to have investigated many more technologies than I actually managed during this time, overall I would consider this time well spent. In addition to releasing two applications to the Windows Store and contributing to several public Github projects (more on this later) I managed to rack up over 1000 rep on StackOverflow in just a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, during this time, I didn't achieve my primary goal; namely finding a project that could potentially be grown into a marketable product and form the basis of a company. While there were no shortage of ideas and there still remain a couple of "coals in the fire", I don't think I've yet found the gap in the market I'm looking for. One slight positive note here is that I have, at the very least, determined a couple of markets I'm very keen on investigating further and in which I'd like to work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this visualization I have employed step count (vertical bars), weight (yellow line with dotted yellow representing ideal weight) and fat-mass (red line with dotted red representing ideal fat-mass) as a (very rough) approximation of health. While, in theory, I should have had more leisure time available to exercise over the course of the year, in real terms I found that I did far less than expected. This was due to a number of factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StarLizard, being a company that revolves around football, had regular football matches/tournaments between company staff which were of a very high standard. I played in as many of these as possible and, once I left StarLizard, I very much missed the exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My commute to work each day involved a (voluntary) walk from St Pancras station to Camden Lock - and back again - every day. This constituted 30 minutes/5000 steps of valuable exercise each day that was no longer necessary when I started working from home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ran a football team for my village that played in the local Bedfordshire league. Unfortunately, due to lack of players this team folded at the end of last season leaving me entirely bereft of football for the majority of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At punching-weight, I aim to be 11st and 15% fat-mass. This used to be a fairly common occurrence while playing football regularly but, as can be seen, I've not managed to get back into a similar condition this year. Fortunately, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; managed to avoid devolving into a complete bucket of lard thanks to several things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parenthood - As any parent will tell you, being a parent is both exhausting and relentless. While previously I would undertake very little exercise in the evening, nowadays I expend a significant amount of energy each evening running around after my daughter. While not often recognised, this constitutes a fairly high level of activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparation for Touring Europe - During this time I did &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of very physical work. From lugging construction materials and tools around to disassembling and reassembling the van, the average day was extremely active, especially when compared to sitting in an office chair for eight hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European Tour - as can be seen from the step count, although a great deal of time was spent driving, our time away involved a lot of other activity. This activity (particularly loading and unloading the van each day!) provided a lot of exercise and helped keep me fit over the summer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swimming - In a desperate attempt to remain in some sort of shape, I have recently started swimming semi-regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, something that came as no surprise but for which I failed to anticipate the true impact, was the effect of not exercising on my state of mind and general happiness. Having always been an active and optimistic individual, I completely underestimated the tight correlation between these two characteristics. Mid-November saw me at my least active and, as I've come to realise, my least productive/focused (as evidenced by the sudden surge in StackOverflow rep!). Fortunately I try be somewhat self-reflective and, recognising that my diminished level of activity might be a possible cause for a perceived lack of progress, I decided to start swimming again as a means to address this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while I'm still not exercise as much as I would like, I at least feel like my activity levels are sufficient to allow me to focus on projects and achieve my deliverables. Moving forward I very much hope to re-establish the village football team in time for next season or join another team such that I get at least a couple of games a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In counterpoint to the Health visualization described above, the Finances visualization shows a relative interpretation of my financial health across the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, when considering a career-break, I tried to calculate a monthly "burn-rate" (i.e. total out-goings per month). Given I was not planning to change my lifestyle at all and my partner and I had already planned a number of holidays, I arrived at a rough estimate of £3k per month. This was affordable and, while it would put a dent in my savings, wouldn't leave me worrying about money at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through-out the year there were a number of factors that further affected my finances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touring Europe in the van cost significantly more than I estimated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My daughter's nursery care was cheaper than expected since moving her from four days a week to three (instead having an additional 'daddy-day-care' day).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I typically spend a significant amount on computer hardware, this year I required very little but for a relatively cheap new server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, looking back across the year (and excluding large one-off payments like buying the van) it seems my burn-rate was closer to £2k, one third less than I had planned. This coupled with receiving returns on previous investments meant I actually ended the year significantly better off than I started it. While this definitely wouldn't be the case were I to continue the career-break for a second year, it is very reassuring to know that I could, should I decide to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Github contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the year - although predominantly in the last few months - I made 368 commits to Github. These were spread across a couple of dozen repositories but mostly focused on the (private) repository for &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/littlelittle/9nblggh51b1b"&gt;LittleLittle&lt;/a&gt; and my (statically generated &amp;amp; github-pages hosted) &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/ibebbs.github.io"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, I contributed to several open source repositories, most notably the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit"&gt;UWP Community Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; (1000 stars) and &lt;a href="https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts"&gt;Live-Charts&lt;/a&gt; (875 stars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given 2016 was a leap-year, 368 commits in 366 days averages (just!) over one a day. Overall I'm quite pleased with this level of commitment and the quantity of work it represents, especially considering the amount of time this year spent not working. Additionally, for the last three months of this year, my partner and I have both elected to work four-day weeks as we felt it represented a better balance between parental and nursery care for our daughter. For me this meant Thursdays became "daddy-day-care" so that I could take my daughter swimming - something we both really enjoy - but which adversely affected my productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward I intend to start publishing much more of my work to public repositories including regular updates to my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/Spikes"&gt;"Spikes"&lt;/a&gt; repository which contains investigative projects and examples for solutions to various StackOverflow questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking of StackOverflow questions, the next visualization shows StackOverflow Reputation accumulation across the year (light blue line) with gains shown day-by-day (dark blue boxes). While I predominantly consider it a distraction, I really enjoy answering questions on StackOverflow, probably due to the awesome &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification"&gt;gamification&lt;/a&gt; employed on the &lt;a href="http://stackexchange.com/"&gt;StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a low level of fairly constant reputation gain, most of the gains came in short bursts. As discussed above, I attribute this losing focus on my main projects due to inactivity. Still, there are far worse forms of procrastination than helping people and I consider this a relatively good use of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently endeavoring to get the 'Fanatic' badge (visit StackOverflow for 100 days consecutively) but trying not to let it get in the way of other work. This usually means only answering questions when I can quickly point the asker in the right direction but I will occasionally field a more challenging question when it's &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/system.reactive"&gt;something I'm particularly interested in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blog posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the year I have written and published 22 blog posts - totaling nearly 24,000 words - across a range of subjects including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D PRINTING (1) APACHE KAFKA (1) APACHE ZOOKEEPER (1) ATTACHED PROPERTY (1) BDD (1) BEHAVIORAL (1) BLOG (3) CAREER BREAK (1) CLIENT-SIDE FRAMEWORK (2) CQRS (1) DART (1) DATAFLOW (1) DOCKER (1) DVD RIPPING (1) EF (1) ELASTIC STACK (4) ELASTICSEARCH (4) EVENT SOURCING (1) EVENTS (1) EVENTSOURCING (1) FUTURE (1) GITHUB (2) GROWTH (1) HYPERLINK (1) IOT (1) JAVASCRIPT (2) JS (1) KIBANA (4) LITTLELITTLE (1) LOGSTASH (4) MAPLIN (1) MONITORING (4) MVVM (1) NANOSERVER (1) NETWORKING (4) PARENTHOOD (1) PATTERNS (1) PRODUCTIVITY (1) RASPBERRYPI (1) REACTIVE (7) REST (1) ROBOX (1) RX (7) SQL (1) STATE MACHINES (1) SVG (1) SYSLOG (4) TESTING (1) TODDLERBOX (3) TOOLKIT (2) TPL (2) TRAVEL (1) TYPESCRIPT (1) UWP (7) VISUAL STUDIO (2) VISUAL STUDIO CODE (1) WEBRX (2) WINDOWS SERVER 2016 (1) WYAM (1) XAML (2) XBOX (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This content garners an average of around 110 unique visitors and 400 page views every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these posts - &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/07/the-week-in-net-972016/"&gt;"The absolute easiest way to use SVG icons in UWP apps"&lt;/a&gt; was featured in &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/07/the-week-in-net-972016/"&gt;"The week in .NET – 9/7/2016"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in, I think I've added some valuable content to my blog this last year but feel like I should have tried harder to increase it's reach. While writing these blog posts inevitably takes a considerably amount of time, I intend to continue making as many new posts as possible, hopefully across an increased range of subjects and - by submitting to various aggregation blogs - with increased readership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commitments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This timeline displays any days I had expected to work yet was unable to for a variety of reasons. Over the course of the year this accounted for 42 days, mostly the Thursdays that have become my "daddy-day-care" day and during which I take my daughter swimming. While these "commitments" would have been worked around had I been in full-time employment, the flexibility of working when I can as opposed to when I have to has undoubtedly led to a greater degree of motiviation and concentration when I am in front of the computer.&lt;/p&gt;



                                </content>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, having realized that we had no commitments or prior engagements until the following Tuesday, my partner and I decided to go on a trip. We rapidly packed bags for ourselves and our little girl, threw them in the van and set off with no set destination other than "the south-west". We ended up staying in a small farm on Exmoor and having a terrific time walking on the moor and visiting nearby sites.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's been over three months since my last blog post. "What have you been doing?" I hear you (the hypothetical reader) ask. Well... well I'll tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having left my previous permanent position in January, I decided the time was right for a &lt;strong&gt;career break&lt;/strong&gt;. Having been &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off?language=en"&gt;inspired to take a career break&lt;/a&gt; some six years ago, I knew how rejuvenating time off work can be and how reinvigorating it is when you finally have some time to pick and choose what it is you want to do and, more importantly, how. Indeed, last time I took a career break I ended up founding a company which - while not successful enough to prevent me having to return to employment - was massively educational, incredibly liberating and a whole lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my motivations for this career break are vastly different to those of six years ago. At that time I had just emerged from a somewhat turbulent relationship and was looking to - &lt;em&gt;sorry for the cliché&lt;/em&gt; - "re-find" myself; this time I am in a stable and happy relationship with my partner who last year gave birth to our little baby girl. And while, six years ago, I could - and was happy to - survive on very meagre savings, I am now lucky enough to be in a position where financial pressures are not an issue, at least in the short-term. Finally, while I had very little idea of what I was going to do during my last career break (which itself was extremely liberating in that you are suddenly open to being able to say "yes" to pretty much anything) this time I have a much more developed concept of how I want to use this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my motivations and desires for the coming months will be the subject of future blog posts, I have started putting together a &lt;a href="https://trello.com/b/KoTWuFUi/public-board"&gt;public Trello board&lt;/a&gt; of ideas/projects I want to undertake. It's just a start and by no means comprehensive but I thought some transparency around my ideas and goals (not to mention progress!) would be good for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though I want to share what I've been doing - and why there have been no blog posts - for the last three months. You see, a primary motivation for taking time out of my career now was to spend time with my young family and maximise the use of my partner's remaining maternity leave. To this end, shortly after leaving my previous job, my partner and I decided to &lt;strong&gt;take our baby on a road trip around Europe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing really couldn't have been better; my partner still had a few months of maternity leave remaining, the baby was still happy to have long naps in the back of the car whenever we drove anywhere and I was still keen on buying a day-van (it's been a &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; with me for a while now). So in February we started planning and looking for a motor that could comfortably cart the three of us around Europe and by mid March we'd bought an imported Nissan Elgrand E51 Ryder Autech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://zdfcta.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y3mRDVqstf6XsjN73biGoYnN5s-SzVcHx9pEdYl2S_wM803HpiosWK5Skxm-kskeHTMkahk_PIdejAp70x14KCaOwmZb6OvAvAig8uqI4bdBs2Pb_lAUsm-O_2lO8krW_18ReDVMLXqVkJWUGUSJ-d80bOIi8ciWIgyxDzL5fw4qF4?width=1796&amp;amp;height=1347&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="My other baby"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the Elgrand is an MPV and not a campervan (a mostly pragmatic decision based on the fact we could use it on a daily basis after the trip and only a little bit due to "love at first drive") so there was a lot of work to do in order to prepare it for such a long journey. Therefore, between March and May, I researched, built and installed a bunch of modifications for the Elgrand to support us on our adventure. This included a custom built leisure battery / charging system enclosure, custom built frame to mount the electrical systems and luggage, routing of cabling around the Elgrand and several internal modifications for enhancing the navigation / ICE systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I documented these modifications on the &lt;a href="http://elgrandoc.uk/"&gt;Elgrand Owners Club website&lt;/a&gt;. This site proved invaluable in terms of information about working on the Elgrand and I wanted to give something back to the active and very helpful community there. Due to limitations in the website's forum, the details had to be split across five posts which - if you're interested - can be found here: &lt;a href="http://elgrandoc.uk/forum/index.php?threads/touring-europe-in-an-elgrand-part-i.3311/"&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://elgrandoc.uk/forum/index.php?threads/touring-europe-in-an-elgrand-part-ii.3312/"&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://elgrandoc.uk/forum/index.php?threads/touring-europe-in-an-elgrand-part-iii.3313/"&gt;Part III&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://elgrandoc.uk/forum/index.php?threads/touring-europe-in-an-elgrand-part-iv.3314/"&gt;Part IV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://elgrandoc.uk/forum/index.php?threads/touring-europe-in-an-elgrand-part-v.3315/"&gt;Part V&lt;/a&gt;. After just a couple of days these posts have already garnered significant praise and numerous follow on questions so I feel pretty good about having spent the time writing these posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, it occurred to me that this work could almost have been a case-study in Agile development. Not being a carpenter or mechanic and my work on cars to date having been pretty much limited to topping up the oil, I started this project from an absolute level of maximum ignorance. Fortunately as both a stake holder and engineer, it was easy to outline use-cases for the work which, while I didn't actually document them at the time, would have included some choice ones such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"As a driver I need a non-Japanese navigation system so I know where the smeg I'm supposed to be going!",&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"As a parent I need a fridge in the van so that we can keep food for the baby food fresh and - hopefully - the baby healthy" and,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"As a caffeine junkie I need a means of making coffee in the van so that I don't murder everyone the morning after we spend a night in it!"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These could then be naturally prioritized and, where possible, undertaken concurrently by my partner and I. If something went well, we could close it off and move onto the next thing; if it didn't we could reevaluate it's value / priority in light of what we had. This way we managed to hit our deadline (the ferry departure - which we put off "committing" to until as late as possible) with as much high value work done as possible. More importantly, at departure (aka deployment) time, we had a significantly lower level of ignorance such that, should anything go wrong while we were "live", we'd actually stand a chance of fixing it without having to - possibly literally - "roll back" to England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, some of this terminology is undoubtedly tenuous but, having had hours and hours to reflect on this work while driving around Europe, it was rewarding to see how much more effective an iterative approach to problem solving can be. Who knows if we'd ever have got away if we'd tried to plan &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; up front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we departed England in mid-May and returned mid-July and had a truly fantastic adventure. In &lt;strong&gt;58 days&lt;/strong&gt; we travelled &lt;strong&gt;7912 miles&lt;/strong&gt; and visited &lt;strong&gt;20 countries&lt;/strong&gt;. Along the way we met a number of old friends, made a lot of new friends and saw some amazing sites and scenery. We learned a lot, not only about the various cultures / histories around Europe but also about ourselves and our daughter. And we laughed a lot, mostly about the quirks of the various cultures we were experiencing but also - in retrospect at least - about some of the challenges we faced along the way; like having to park up in a field at a border crossing in order to buy the vignette that would allow us to drive the car in the country we were about to cross in to, and getting visited by both a swarm of monstrously huge locust type insects and a heavily armed and somewhat suspicious (the Elgrand has very dark privacy glass) border guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really did experience so much that I frequently find myself remembering something from the trip that a) I had somehow already forgotten and b) seems like both a lifetime &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; just a few days ago. Fortunately my partner kept a very detailed (and anonymised) blog of our journey in which she does an terrific job of capturing the fun and freedom we enjoyed while away. Should you be interested, you can read it &lt;a href="https://bigspune.wordpress.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we're home. The baby has started nursery and my partner is returning to work. While I'm still having to consciously work out where I am when I wake up in the night (seriously, after two months of staying somewhere different every night, this seems to be a thing at the moment) and we're still trying to get the house back into some semblance of order, life is returning to our own special approximation of normality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For four days a week and for the foreseeable future, I will have pretty much all day to do... well, pretty much anything I want. It's an exciting time in the world of .NET given the recent release of .NET Core and Microsoft's assimilation of Xamarin. Graph and document data stores (aka NoSQL) continue to make inroads on the traditional strong holds of legacy relational databases. And there are some profound changes in the broader world of software development such as the continuing move towards containerized deployment and cloud infrastructures. I'm very much looking forward to investigating / leveraging all these in the months to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows where it will lead. I will certainly be keeping my ear to the ground should an exciting job/contract come around. Ideally I'd want something remote / freelance which I could do on my terms and, should the right opportunity drop in my lap, I'd certainly be open to it. That said, what I'd really like to do is resurrect my company and see where I can take it. I have a couple of ideas with potential but will hold off on developing them until I've refamiliarised myself with the current trends in software development because, even though it's only been a few months, it feels like I've been out of the game for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, game on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've just become a father. It's amazing and I'm loving every day, from waking up in the morning and being greeted by huge grin from my little girl to putting her to bed in the evening when she can barely keep her eyes open. My baby instantaneously became priority number one and has left little time for other passions like home programming projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, simultaneously, I have found the time since my baby was born to be some of the most productive time of my life. Since she her birth, I've spent every hour possible with her, worked regular hours - and been productive during those hours - at my day job, got an unexpectedly healthy amount of sleep and still managed to complete a significant amount of work on personal projects as well as creating and writing this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reflecting on why this might be, I came up with one simple, inescapable conclusion: &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs" title="ibebbs Github Profile"&gt;my Github profile&lt;/a&gt;. More specifically the "Current Streak" of contributions. You see, I am a sucker for gamification and seeing that "Current Streak" increase each day is remarkably rewarding. As such, I am finding time each day - no matter how little - to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, I'd get home in the evening, think about the projects I had to work on, realise that there probably wouldn't be enough time to make significant progress and procrastinate about it until I had more time available to "get things done properly" - which was happening increasingly rarely. Now, instead of focusing on some distant goal, I simply think about finding &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; I can do and publish to Github in whatever time I have available. It really doesn't matter what it is, as long as I get the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/devices/surface-pro-4" title="Microsoft Surface Pro 4"&gt;Surface&lt;/a&gt; out and start. Almost always, once I've started something, I get engrossed in it and am able to spend way more time than I thought might be available on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I'm writing this post from the sofa in my front room having spent a wonderful evening with my other half and little girl. Not having had time to make a commit today, I decided not to get an early night and instead tucked them into their respective beds before heading back down stairs to get a start on this post. Initially I had planned simply jot down a few ideas and possibly write a sentence or two before committing to Github and retiring for the evening. Yet here I am still writing after several paragraphs (and &lt;a href="https://music.microsoft.com/album/london-grammar/if-you-wait-deluxe-edition/bz.EE99E107-0100-11DB-89CA-0019B92A3933?action=play" title="London Grammar on Groove Music"&gt;one very enjoyable album&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably won't finish tonight, and definitely won't publish this post until I've had time to re-read and edit it. But I've got my commit for the day and made an unexpected amount of progress on a blog post about making an unexpected amount of progress. In short, I got &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; done and that feels good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Using a Hyperlink in MVVM</title>
		<updated>2016-08-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>
                                        


&lt;p&gt;The XAML (i.e. WPF, WinRT, UWP family) &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.documents.hyperlink.aspx"&gt;Hyperlink&lt;/a&gt; is a terrific little control (ok, it's not actually a &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.aspx"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; - it's a &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.contentelement.aspx"&gt;ContentElement&lt;/a&gt; - but it does allow interaction hence using the term control here). It follows the current environment's theme such that the user naturally knows it's a link that can be clicked and it can be embedded inside &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.textblock.aspx"&gt;TextBlock&lt;/a&gt; elements so that it naturally flows with the other content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/ibebbs/f3b4efb09f9b0ea36397a9ab462823df.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, out of the box, this control's functionality is somewhat limited. As standard, it is simply able to perform navigation on any &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242682"&gt;Frame&lt;/a&gt; element the control is hosted within. Any other type of behavior requires the developer to subscribe to the control's &lt;code&gt;OnHyperlinkClicked&lt;/code&gt; event and perform the required operations from code-behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, neither of these approaches work for 'ViewModel First' &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/hh848246.aspx"&gt;MVVM&lt;/a&gt;, which, after many years employing MVVM is by far my favoured approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a project I've been working on which employs this pattern, a state-machine is used to track application state and each transition between states causing a navigation to be performed in the UI. In one view within the application, there was a desire to instigate a state-machine transition by clicking on a &lt;code&gt;Hyperlink&lt;/code&gt; embedded within some text. Ideally, when clicked, the &lt;code&gt;Hyperlink&lt;/code&gt; would execute an &lt;code&gt;ICommand&lt;/code&gt; instance data-bound to the view from the view-model. Obviously this wasn't possible as standard so I started thinking through alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first inclination was to restyle a &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.button.aspx"&gt;Button&lt;/a&gt; to look like a Hyperlink. This would, ostensibly, be fairly straight forward and naturally provided a Command &lt;code&gt;DependencyProperty&lt;/code&gt; to bind to. However, keeping the hyperlink styled as per the current system theme would be arduous to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting this aside, I came across &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11433814"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; which employed an attached property to start a process (normally a browser to display external content) on the host PC. Realising this approach could be extended to accomplish my goals I refactored it to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/ibebbs/654f519eec134135f7f9469150b07438.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which can be used as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/ibebbs/0ae7c2e0ed3c531858f5ee01c16157b8.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et voilá, a &lt;code&gt;Hyperlink&lt;/code&gt; control which is able to execute a data-bound &lt;code&gt;ICommand&lt;/code&gt; instance. Obviously it could be extended further to disable the hyperlink when the command reports execution is disabled (via &lt;code&gt;CanExecuteChanged&lt;/code&gt;) and provide a CommandParamter binding for passing additional information through to the command execution, but in a lot of instances - and certainly for me in this scenario - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it"&gt;YAGNI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've long loved the idea of home automation. From X10 and LightwaveRF through to modern Bluetooth and Wifi connected devices, I have played with dozens of technologies in search of home automation nirvana. But recently I have watched with growing bewilderment at the incredible number of "cloud-connected" home automation devices being released and the eagerness with which they're snapped up by naive consumers hungry to control everything from the carefree comfort of their iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, while you can buy a myriad of IoT devices off the shelf nowadays, they nearly all come with some form of "cloud-service" that is necessary in order for the device to work as sold. As the more wily of reader will no doubt be aware, this exposes your home network to innumerable &lt;a href="https://it.slashdot.org/story/16/10/03/1359200/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-which-took-down-krebs-on-security-website-with-ddos-attack-released"&gt;security concerns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://it.slashdot.org/story/16/08/08/1449221/hackers-make-the-first-ever-ransomware-for-smart-thermostats"&gt;potential abuses&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/16/01/14/1347243/nest-thermostat-bug-leaves-owners-without-heating"&gt;external point of failure&lt;/a&gt; that cannot be closed/fixed without sacrificing some or all of the functionality of the new fangled device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I understand the ostensible benefits of this approach (ease of setup, remote use without manually opening firewall ports, centralised patching and upgrading, etc), sacrificing control of (potentially hazardous or invasive) devices within my home is not a value proposition I am comfortable with. I would very much like to see a new (or is that old?) breed of device that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does not require an internet connection to operate with all features intact,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with which the owner can proactively decide what control and data is available to servers outside of the home network and,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which surface simple, open interfaces to the owner allowing them to completely control all aspects of the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I'd like to drop the 'Inter' from IoT and expand the 'net' to become a 'Network of Things', or NoT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the consumer market, I am undoubtedly swimming against the tide here. Fortunately with the rise of hobbyist devices such as Arduino and RaspberryPi, IoT technologies have been democratised to the extent that anyone with just the smallest ability with a soldering iron and faculty with an IDE can create such devices for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, I present my first (finished) NoT device, the...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;MonsterPi&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, while setting up my (living room) home cinema, I came across the &lt;a href="http://www.adverts.ie/home-audio/monster-hts-1600-home-theatre-powercenter-5-outlet-with-stage-2-clean-power-purge-protector-uk-version/7055360"&gt;Monster Power HTS 1600&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.scan.co.uk/"&gt;Scan's website&lt;/a&gt;. It seems Monster Products were end-of-lining their power products in the UK (the above link was literally the only one I could find that still works!) and Scan were selling them off at £30 a piece. It was exactly what I was looking for at the time and, not being one to pass up a bargain, I bought two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://0oiczq.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y3mwcGE45bQwRPaCXRNuB9tGejIT6aSpahgDN02u9ag661uCa_ZmYbNnaKz2aW81rjG8BTgsUhtZ0aDQ8ioIsagbcFP6LtM-IgV_rcPoCs8UI4dZNegv8JembGIuIr7ETkwTZwOTEUjsAAbQHy0jCyAGNkGu3NJZLkXjnGwgzUMlTI?width=700&amp;amp;height=466&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="One of the few remaining pictures online of the Monster Power HTS 1600 UK version"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both devices found homes powering and protected my front room and study AV equipment and, to this day, I am still very happy with them. However, I always felt that Monster had missed a trick with this product: the ability to individually and - ideally - remotely turn each of the sockets on the unit on and off as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft announced that Windows IoT Core would run on a RaspberryPi the learning curve ahead of making this happen evaporated and I knew it was something I wanted to do. Unfortunately both Monster Power devices were in full time use and I didn't want to potentially sacrifice one on a project that might not work and could consign the device to the scrap yard. Given that you couldn't purchase the UK version of these devices any more and that, when they occasionally appeared on eBay, they'd invariably be priced at £100+ the project was indefinitely parked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a couple of months ago, a 'used' one appeared on eBay without a reserve and with bidding at thirty odd quid having just a few hours to go. I placed a bid without really hoping it would be successful and, to my surprise, ended up winning the auction for £40'ish including delivery. When it arrived I was delighted to find that it seemed to be brand new and unused (twisty wire on all the cables, supplementary cables still in sealed bags, etc). Plugging it in proved that everything worked as it should so everything was in place to build the MonsterPi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for the time and space required to start hacking up the hardware, I took a look into what was required to write a headless UWP app, self-hosting a HTTP REST endpoint that could be deployed to the RaspberryPi and set values on the GPIO pins necessary to control the &lt;a href="http://www.waveshare.com/rpi-relay-board.htm"&gt;Waveshare RaspberryPi Relay Board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't take long to find &lt;a href="https://github.com/tomkuijsten/restup"&gt;Restup&lt;/a&gt;, a beautifully simple if somewhat minimal 'Webserver for Universal Windows Apps'. The github repository provided ample samples for writing various types of 'controller' and in less than an hour, I had a working solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the Waveshare relay board just required GPIO pins to be set in order to control the relay (low to close, high to open) this was achieved very simply using the classes available in the &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.gpio.aspx"&gt;Windows.Devices.Gpio namespace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment was taken care of by Visual Studio and configuration performed using the Windows IoT Core Device Portal. The Device Portal allows you to configure deployed apps to run at start up thereby creating a "service-like" experience for headless apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://0oidzq.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y3myuJMpQJ0iee-DzmucnuUu2r69IZ2c_KNukHEjoPB0--qRcndLbk0EwUszv8MLYj207fNIWEelQn4TYtW40FVp_y77RW-aTL3AcxQWcowLMB_zsw9jYdH0SwepJ0l6_XC0z9erqkYt4k4TaUBdnqxPYUlSf786xKVx1zwTC4jEsg?width=1363&amp;amp;height=905&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Using the device portal to set Start-up apps"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full source code is available on my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/MonsterPi"&gt;Github account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardware side of things proved to be both easier and more tricky than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought fitting the Pi was going to be child's-play when, upon opening the Monster Power chasis I found that the configuration of sockets providing isolation for RJ11 and RJ45 devices (phone and ethernet respectively) matched the layout of the ethernet and USB connectors of the Pi almost perfectly. Furthermore, these sockets were mounted on an easily removable daughter-board providing an obvious way to fix the pi in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://nhtcwg.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y3mKq_74GixCoND7XvyavcDTjnNPdW2xd58RqEk1KZtO4f8nqKhcwyGbMRJqYhtuIHOmJCrJo6O-pltKB1pW0DFAHNy2oi6CNuyOle6TUxrjb4UzQo5_uDIPhNAP1uF8llVVLds4J6Bcp5b2s0GRI_T1uLx__qES0eUimFSxaTWddk?width=1024&amp;amp;height=576&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="The sockets on the RaspberryPi aligned almost perfectly with the RJ11 isolator sockets"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While alignment wasn't perfect, filing the holes in the chasis to provide access to all ports would be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexity came when I realised that, although the Monster Power included a micro-controller driven digital display, it was unlikely that the DC subsystem in place to power this would be adequate for the RaspberryPi. So here I had to get creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a small &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01H0OH3PI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1"&gt;12v 80W switching power supply&lt;/a&gt; which would fit down one side of the Moster Power chasis and wired it to the 240v input of using the conveniently provided ring terminals. I used a &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/3DPrintingWithTheCelRobox"&gt;custom printed bracket&lt;/a&gt; to secure the PSU in place while providing a platform to mount the &lt;a href="http://www.waveshare.com/rpi-relay-board.htm"&gt;Waveshare RaspberryPi Relay Board&lt;/a&gt; above, in close proximity to the sockets I wanted to control with the relays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The live wire to the three sockets to be controlled by relays were daisy-chained together so one side of this wire was cut from each socket and connected to the normally-closed output of the relay (extending where necessary using crimp connectors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://zphbnq.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y3mBGmj_-221eHr5ChhkWQfyEOjewU-6JEKOKlqHR-UqR0eMZdf2xPtI5qfP_K1rjguEplhOWObkMJ2fiGI4T4WSQOGh8GfodMLL2lPWD5QZFnBFPYwPUID3FZgVTYndwwL5jDybtRBC6JE_hhcTokWGrmppuLoHccNLsmFZyUsAvM?width=576&amp;amp;height=1024&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="12v switching PSU with relay board mounted in custom bracket"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the perspective in the picture makes it look like it hangs over the edge of the chasis, it does actually fit. It's tight, but it fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01CUA5Q74/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1"&gt;12V To 5V 3A 15W Power Converter Regulator with Micro USB Cable&lt;/a&gt; to power the RaspberryPi and - given I now had plenty of power to spare, decided to also fit the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Step-Down-Step-down-Power-Module/dp/B00ENE55SQ/ref=pd_nav_hcs_bia_t_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=J91844QA901NNMPP9XHJ"&gt;4-port USB power module&lt;/a&gt; I had bought, but not used, for our &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/WotNoBlogPosts"&gt;travels earlier in the year&lt;/a&gt;. Again, this aligned almost perfectly in the remaining holes in the Monster Power chasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://nhtcwg.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y3mKq_74GixCoND7XvyavcDTjnNPdW2xd58RqEk1KZtO4f8nqKhcwyGbMRJqYhtuIHOmJCrJo6O-pltKB1pW0DFAHNy2oi6CNuyOle6TUxrjb4UzQo5_uDIPhNAP1uF8llVVLds4J6Bcp5b2s0GRI_T1uLx__qES0eUimFSxaTWddk?width=1024&amp;amp;height=576&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="The sockets on the USB power module aligned almost perfectly with the RJ11 isolator sockets"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these were mounted - upside down - on a custom printed bracket using the screw holes for the original daughter board to secure it in place. Terminal connectors were used to provide connection to the power supply just in case I needed to remove the components at a later date for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://zphcnq.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y3mMyQU1JCq5r9g0pnmuLGrrVm1-_D8Bq9UVm5uZgUD2lx9t3LVnjEIgWzqzwKeKbju29iHfBntmTX0FPZFKzWK6RAnFwWw-rxMfWyslJf52FN4XkFlglfGHc97-z24asPfR-NLEAd8nEE9e8X9V-tEP_wen7kF0zsAchvQJYwOjJk?width=576&amp;amp;height=1024&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Mounting the RaspberryPi and USB power module on a custom bracket"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, boards were fixed in place and a ribbon cable connected between the GPIO socket on the RaspberryPi and the relay board to allow control of the relays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://nhtewg.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y3mYTQzOsTukjrHcb69XX-50V18rcvHJUP4R8u6hmsgR1yAm2DCpFzoK9UdUNyfxseH59qtuRbVeIVVX9AM1h8lde7IbZDOPRYz0le7cac0bFkoC4pzsyjVKNO3QapjDdlCK-awMaL_NOhYEw6rW4_7lMTobDNRqGrK17yE1SmeRHA?width=1024&amp;amp;height=576&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Brackets in place and RaspberryPi fitted"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a thorough check to make sure there were no shorts on any of the connections and that I had connected polarity correctly, I plugged it in and turned it on....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and everything worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RaspberryPi booted but didn't switch the sockets on as - I think - not having a network connection meant it couldn't get an IP address which meant the software hadn't enabled to relays due to being configured to fail safe (leave the sockets off). The power indicator on the USB power module suggested it was working fine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I relocated to another room where a network connection was available. I plugged it in, turned it on and saw the network connection LED's start blinking. After 15-20 seconds or so while the RaspberryPi booted, the relays tickets on and I was able to hit the REST endpoint from &lt;a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt;. I'd even managed to get the names of the sockets on the rest service to match the sockets the relays were controlling, although I admit this was more luck than judgement (I had completely expected to have to re-configure the software to match after the hardware was complete).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plugged in a small table lamp and recorded this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=03DF8A28BD9D0BC9&amp;amp;resid=3DF8A28BD9D0BC9%21266322&amp;amp;authkey=AI5IzCXupiYl-CU" width="600px" height="340px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boom! (Figuratively speaking of course... the MonsterPi didn't literally go boom... yet :0)&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;I've long loved the idea of home automation. From X10 and LightwaveRF through to modern Bluetooth and Wifi connected devices, I have played with dozens of technologies in search of home automation nirvana. But recently I have watched with growing bewilderment at the incredible number of "cloud-connected" home automation devices being released and the eagerness with which they're snapped up by naive consumers hungry to control everything from the carefree comfort of their iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Really that got out of hand fast! I had no idea so many people would be interested in letting their toddler loose on their XBox controller. In fact, there have been many things that have surprised me about this app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquisition rate has increased&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of expected an initial burst of acquisitions then a slow tail off but this hasn't happened. As it's only been a little over a month since ToddlerBox was released to the store, I guess there's every possibility that it's still in the "burst" stage and theres just more interest in apps of this type. Well, here's hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews have been extremely polarized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost without exception, reviews have been 4-5 stars or 1 star. Also, while a couple of the 1 star ratings are to do with app functionality (it seems a couple of people have issues running even this basic UWP app) the overwhelming majority of 1 star ratings are due to peoples dislike of ads; because...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ads are a very risky business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most parents, I am extremely cautious about what my toddler is exposed to. Therefore I was extremely cautious about adding advertising as a means of revenue to ToddlerBox, regardless of how small or out of the way they were.
After completing the Ad-Mediation questions in the Windows Store and being assured that ads would be both age rated and not "tracking", I felt a lot better about the idea and decided a small banner ad on the instructions screen would be pretty harmless. Furthermore, throughout the process of adding the banner, I didn't see a single advert I would be concerned about putting in front of my child; most were simple flashing inbox icons or the like.
However, after discussing ToddlerBox with a friend, he decided to install it on his Xbox and I was very upset to see that the ads being displayed were both more intrusive and more "click-baity" than any I had seen previously. I am now investigating ways to generate some revenue from the app but without upsetting parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviews shown in the store are not "all reviews"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the publisher of ToddlerBox, I get to see all reviews left about the app on the store. Due to all the previous points, the app is currently averaging about a 2.6 star rating across 50 odd reviews. However, when viewing the app in the Store on my friend's XBox, it was shown as having a 4.5 star rating from just 2 reviews. Now, while some of the reviews I can see are translated from foreign languages, most are in English and I'm therefore at a loss to explain why they're not being displayed when an XBox in the English local browses the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just toddlers using ToddlerBox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had more than one review stating how good this game is to play after consuming various illicit substances ;0P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as described above, while acquisition rate has fluctuated on a daily basis, the overall trend in acquisition shows unexpected growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://bnljqq-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3msqT1msmkJ_32Jewx8Ysuoys0lC35GCLY-aQPyJ9YhR75KMswOLcznSPGOOBGhhsMRb6qK3_xh_qr3h1Xh-vFwmSog1_HoOS-Isj1lMoFPpuV42oAwJi3A5JiY-ToAirVoZDnz2gQ7N6jUed82zW83IZ_qQcbqWGw1ekaNh4wjBU?width=660&amp;amp;height=252&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:660px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Acquisitions over App Lifetime"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily usage also shows that a healthy number of acquisitions are being used regularly, with nearly 800 people using ToddlerBox nearly 1700 times just yesterday (19th December):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://bnlkqq-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3mBC-i0nboWq0ibRyIcBhs1O2MnfOUx-OxTQZDUNHbh-eVRbfH0xP9-p9hLJqC82i1SBB5ZfpcfmTlvuZwMBD-Gt0BZZC-IvVCJOd1jzexDoiC-BV4LG7X2aOyOapkCKK6wM6WWffluiuD5MKKet6MfEIjTWNZMCpFx1FP13suiCY?width=660&amp;amp;height=249&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:660px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Daily usage"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the Xmas break is almost upon us and I will be returning my attention to ToddlerBox (yes, despite the career break, I try to spend most of my time working on 'serious' projects or study). I have a number of new features in mind for it (including the #1 requested feature of "sound!!") and will be looking to try out a couple of more features of the awesome Win2D library. It's going to be a lot of fun (for me and my little girl) and will hopefully allow ToddlerBox to reach the next major (although admittedly arbitrary) milestone of 25,000 acquisitions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch this space...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Combining the UWP SpeechSynthesizer and AudioGraph APIs</title>

&lt;p&gt;Synchronicity is a wonderful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this morning I was considering using the new &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.speechsynthesis.speechsynthesizer.aspx"&gt;SpeechSynthesizer&lt;/a&gt; capabilities of the UWP platform to add spoken language to my &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/p/toddlerbox/9nblggh3zr4l"&gt;ToddlerBox app for Xbox&lt;/a&gt;. I had already started using the &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audio.audiograph.aspx"&gt;AudioGraph&lt;/a&gt; classes to play sounds in the app so ideally wanted to continue using this API to emit speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, during my morning... ahem... ablutions, I came across &lt;a href="https://mtaulty.com/2017/01/15/windows-10-uwp-iot-core-speechsynthesizer-raspberry-pi-and-audio-popping/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Mike Taulty who was looking to do the same thing but for different reasons. It seems that the RaspberryPi has a firmware issue that causes a &lt;a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/7c312972-6a09-4acd-8a3f-c59485a81d74/clicking-sound-during-start-and-stop-of-audio-playback?forum=WindowsIoT"&gt;popping noise&lt;/a&gt;  every time speech is emitted using the MediaPlayer and AudioGraph seems to be a way of resolving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike had implemented a means of emitting speech via AudioGraph by saving the &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.speechsynthesis.speechsynthesisstream.aspx?f=255&amp;amp;MSPPError=-2147217396"&gt;SpeechSynthesisStream&lt;/a&gt; to a  temporary file and then using multiple &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audio.audiofileinputnode.aspx"&gt;AudioFileInputNode&lt;/a&gt; instances to render the speech to the AudioGraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well", I thought, "there's got to be a better way. How hard can this be..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turns out the answer is: "Not all that hard, but...".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to find a way to eliminate the need for the temporary files and render the speech stream directly to the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I first saved the SpeechSynthesisStream to a file so that I could examine the content. As expected, the file turned out to be a simple 32-bit, mono, ADPCM waveform in &lt;a href="http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/"&gt;WAV/RIFF format&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having previously messed about with AudioGraph I knew there was a way of creating an in-memory waveform and that the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples"&gt;Windows-Universal-Samples github repository&lt;/a&gt; had an &lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/AudioCreation"&gt;AudioCreation sample&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/blob/master/Samples/AudioCreation/cs/AudioCreation/Scenario3_FrameInputNode.xaml.cs"&gt;showed how to do this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, this sample shows how to use the &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audio.audioframeinputnode.quantumstarted"&gt;QuantumStarted event&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn914147"&gt;AudioFrameInputNode&lt;/a&gt; to dynamically add &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audioframe.aspx"&gt;AudioFrame&lt;/a&gt; to the AudioFrameInputNode which are then rendered to the &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/apps/dn914151"&gt;output node&lt;/a&gt;. An extract from the sample is shown here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  unsafe private AudioFrame GenerateAudioData(uint samples)
  {
      // Buffer size is (number of samples) * (size of each sample)
      // We choose to generate single channel (mono) audio. For multi-channel, multiply by number of channels
      uint bufferSize = samples * sizeof(float);
      AudioFrame frame = new Windows.Media.AudioFrame(bufferSize);

      using (AudioBuffer buffer = frame.LockBuffer(AudioBufferAccessMode.Write))
      using (IMemoryBufferReference reference = buffer.CreateReference())
      {
          byte* dataInBytes;
          uint capacityInBytes;
          float* dataInFloat;

          // Get the buffer from the AudioFrame
          ((IMemoryBufferByteAccess)reference).GetBuffer(out dataInBytes, out capacityInBytes);

          // Cast to float since the data we are generating is float
          dataInFloat = (float*)dataInBytes;

          float freq = 1000; // choosing to generate frequency of 1kHz
          float amplitude = 0.3f;
          int sampleRate = (int)graph.EncodingProperties.SampleRate;
          double sampleIncrement = (freq * (Math.PI * 2)) / sampleRate;

          // Generate a 1kHz sine wave and populate the values in the memory buffer
          for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; samples; i++)
          {
              double sinValue = amplitude * Math.Sin(theta);
              dataInFloat[i] = (float)sinValue;
              theta += sampleIncrement;
          }
      }

      return frame;
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, I then refactored this code to read the binary data from the SpeechSynthesisStream rather than generate a sine wave as shown above. This was greatly facilited by the &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh582142.aspx"&gt;WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions.AsStreamForRead&lt;/a&gt; method which allowed me to use basic &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream.aspx"&gt;Stream&lt;/a&gt; methods  (specifically &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream.readbyte.aspx"&gt;Stream.ReadByte()&lt;/a&gt;) instead of having to mess about with &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows.media.speechsynthesis.speechsynthesisstream.readasync.aspx"&gt;IBuffer&lt;/a&gt; instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short order, I ended up with the code below (where &lt;code&gt;_stream&lt;/code&gt; is a member of the containing class pointing to the underlying SpeechSynthesisStream):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    private unsafe void QuantumStarted(AudioFrameInputNode sender, FrameInputNodeQuantumStartedEventArgs args)
    {
        uint numSamplesNeeded = (uint)args.RequiredSamples;

        if (numSamplesNeeded != 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; _stream.Position &amp;lt; _stream.Length)
        {
            uint bufferSize = numSamplesNeeded * sizeof(float);
            AudioFrame frame = new AudioFrame(bufferSize);

            using (AudioBuffer buffer = frame.LockBuffer(AudioBufferAccessMode.Write))
            {
                using (IMemoryBufferReference reference = buffer.CreateReference())
                {
                    byte* dataInBytes;
                    uint capacityInBytes;

                    // Get the buffer from the AudioFrame
                    ((IMemoryBufferByteAccess)reference).GetBuffer(out dataInBytes, out capacityInBytes);

                    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; bufferSize; i++)
                    {
                        if (_stream.Position &amp;lt; _stream.Length)
                        {
                            dataInBytes[i] = (byte)_stream.ReadByte();
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            dataInBytes[i] = 0;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

            _frameInputNode.AddFrame(frame);
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to my surprised, it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encapsulated this code into a class named &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/BlogProjects/blob/master/UwpSpeechAudio/GraphExtensions.cs"&gt;AudioSpeechInputNode&lt;/a&gt; and made this class implement &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audio.iaudioinputnode.aspx"&gt;IAudioInputNode&lt;/a&gt; so it could be treated like any other node in the AudioGraph. Finally I added an extension method to AudioGraph that created instance of this node in the same way that other nodes are created. This is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    AudioSpeechInputNode speechInputNode = await _graph.CreateSpeechInputNodeAsync(new SpeechSynthesizer(), "As input node");
    speechInputNode.AddOutgoingConnection(_outputNode); // device output node
    speechInputNode.Stop();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this node in hand you're then at liberty to call the &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audio.iaudionode.start.aspx"&gt;Start&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audio.iaudionode.stop.aspx"&gt;Stop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audio.iaudionode.reset.aspx"&gt;Reset&lt;/a&gt; methods as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et voila, a SpeechSynthesisStream rendered in an AudioGraph without the need for an intermediary file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You said there was a 'but' ...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes. Three of them actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The big 'but'&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this approach certainly solves the issue with needing temporary files and a 'popping' sound each time speech is emitted, I'm afraid to say it does not resolve the 'popping' noise encountered when the application starts on a RaspberryPi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a good nerd, I had a spare RaspberryPi 3 hanging around with a recent version of Windows 10 IoT Core installed. It took just a few minutes to recompile my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/BlogProjects/tree/master/UwpSpeechAudio"&gt;sample app&lt;/a&gt; to ARM and deploy it to the Pi whereupon I could confirm that there is no popping when emitting speech but there is when the application starts. In fact, I receive three distinct 'pops' during application start-up which, by studiously placing breakpoints, I isolated to &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audio.audiograph.createasync.aspx"&gt;AudioGraph.CreateAsync&lt;/a&gt; (two pops) and &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.media.audio.audiograph.start.aspx"&gt;AudioGraph.Start&lt;/a&gt; (one pop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would have us believe that this is an issue with the RaspberryPi firmware but, as it also occurs on &lt;a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/hardware/dragonboard-410c"&gt;DragonBoard 410c&lt;/a&gt; I'm more inclined to believe it's an issue with the Windows drivers. On a hunch, I've just ordered a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B016CU2PEU"&gt;USB Sound Adapter from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This device is &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to be Windows and RaspberryPi compatible (which doesn't necessarily mean it'll work with IoT Core on RPi) and, if it works, I'll be very interested to see if I still get the popping noises when the application starts. I'll update this post once I have an answer...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The intermediate 'but'&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My code makes a number of assumptions about the format of the SpeechSynthesisStream and encapsulates these as constants. It would be much better to read the format from the WAVE 'fmt ' chunk of the underlying RIFF structures in the stream but, being a pragmatic, &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html"&gt;YAGNI principled&lt;/a&gt; developer... I skipped this for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The small 'but'&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is probably very obvious, the code above is in no way optimised. I'm sure there are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better and faster ways of storing and copying the binary data from the SpeechSynthesisStream into the AudioBuffer (perhaps just using an intermediate byte array would help) but, for now, this code works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show me the code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the code for the above can be found in a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/BlogProjects/tree/master/UwpSpeechAudio"&gt;UWP sample app&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/BlogProjects"&gt;BlogProjects&lt;/a&gt; repository of my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ibebbs"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you find this code helpful or have suggestions for improving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last post, I configured Logstash to extracted source and destination address information from the "Client Access Log" Syslog messages sent by my router and added a number of visualizations to my Kibana dashboard which allow me to explore which local devices are access which remote servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is already very useful, it's almost impossible to remember which devices relate to which IP addresses on the local network, let alone the on the internet. As such, I really want the ability to translate the IP addresses (and, ideally, port numbers) into device, host or protocol names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;translating remote ip addresses to host names&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a local device accesses a remote server it will, ordinarily, do so by resolving an IP address for a host name, for example 'google.com' resolves to the address '216.58.213.110'. On my network, my router acts as a DNS server, resolving names it knows and forwarding unresolved names to Googles DNS servers. A the results of the host name to IP address lookup are cached in the DNS server (e.g. my router) I can perform a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup"&gt;reverse DNS lookup&lt;/a&gt; at very little processing cost and without consuming any WAN bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Logstash comes with a filter that is able to perform this operation called, unsurprisingly, 'dns'. However, to provide a consistent set of fields to Kibana, it requires a couple of additional steps to ensure it functions consistently. Here is the amended &lt;code&gt;syslog.config&lt;/code&gt; with the reverse DNS lookup in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;input {
  tcp {
    port =&amp;gt; 5000
    type =&amp;gt; syslog
  }
  udp {
    port =&amp;gt; 5000
    type =&amp;gt; syslog
  }
}

filter {
    grok {
        match =&amp;gt; [ "message", "&amp;lt;%{POSINT:syslog_pri}&amp;gt;%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp} Vigor\: Local User \(MAC=%{MAC:source_mac}\): %{IP:source_address}(?::%{POSINT:source_port})? -&amp;gt; %{IP:destination_address}(?::%{POSINT:destination_port})? \((?&amp;lt;protocol&amp;gt;TCP|UDP)\)" ]
        add_tag =&amp;gt; "access"
    }
    if "access" in [tags] {
        mutate {
            add_field =&amp;gt; {
              "destination_host" =&amp;gt; "%{[destination_address]}"
            }
        }
        dns {
            reverse =&amp;gt; [ "destination_host" ]
            action =&amp;gt; "replace"
            nameserver =&amp;gt; "192.168.1.1"
        }
    }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts =&amp;gt; ["192.168.1.30:9200"]
    index =&amp;gt; "syslog-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, when an 'access' message is successfully grokked, I add a tag to the tags array field of the message called "access". If another type of message has been received (i.e. a DNS lookup) then the grok pattern won't match and the 'access' tag will not be added to tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;code&gt;grok&lt;/code&gt; filter, I check to see if the tags field contains the 'access' tag and, if so, use the &lt;code&gt;mutate&lt;/code&gt; filter to copy the 'destination_address' field value into a 'destination_host' field. This is done as the &lt;code&gt;dns&lt;/code&gt; filter will replace the field value if a successful reverse DNS lookup is performed but will leave the original value (i.e. the IP address) if a reverse DNS could not be performed. This way we either get the host name or IP address in the 'destination_host' field and it's never empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the changes to configuration in place, I restart Logstash. Then, in Kibana, I refresh the field list for the 'syslog-*' index, add 'destination_host' to the 'Syslog Messages' saved search, load 'Access By Destination Address' visualization and modify it to use 'destination_host' rather than the 'destination_address' field; and get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-AccessByDestinationHostAnalysedVisualization.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Access By Destination Host Analysed Visualization"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While initially it looks promising, a quick look at the list of hosts being accessed shows something peculiar: the domain names have been split into their component parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;analysis, mappings and templates&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for the host names being split is because, by default, ElasticSearch performs 'analysis' on text strings. This analysis involves splitting the strings into discrete words which can be indexed more efficiently. Some strings however, for example domain names, should be treated as a single word and as such we need to prevent ElasticSearch from performing the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How ElasticSearch treats various fields within a message can be controlled by modifying the index mapping. The current mapping for the 'syslog' index can be retrieved by a REST call to the address 'http://[ElasticSearchHost]:9200/syslog-2016.04.12/_mapping'. This returns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "syslog-2016.04.12": {
        "mappings": {
            "syslog": {
                "properties": {
                    "@@timestamp": {
                        "type": "date",
                        "format": "strict_date_optional_time||epoch_millis"
                    },
                    "@@version": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "destination_address": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "destination_host": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "destination_port": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "host": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "message": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "protocol": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "source_address": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "source_mac": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "source_port": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "syslog_pri": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "syslog_timestamp": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "tags": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "type": {
                        "type": "string"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to prevent ElasticSearch from analysing the 'destination_host' field, we need to add an 'index' key with the value 'not_analyzed'. Even though things have been mostly working correctly so far, I can save quite a bit of storage and processing time by marking almost all of the string fields as 'not_analyzed'. This is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "syslog-2016.04.12": {
        "mappings": {
            "syslog": {
                "properties": {
                    "@@timestamp": {
                        "type": "date",
                        "format": "strict_date_optional_time||epoch_millis"
                    },
                    "@@version": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "destination_address": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "destination_host": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "destination_port": {
                        "type": "integer"
                    },
                    "host": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "message": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "protocol": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "source_address": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "source_mac": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "source_port": {
                        "type": "integer"
                    },
                    "syslog_pri": {
                        "type": "integer"
                    },
                    "syslog_timestamp": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "tags": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "type": {
                        "type": "string"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while I could write this mapping directly to the ElasticSearch index, as the index is date-based, I'd have to resend the mapping manually everyday. Instead, I am going to create a mapping template that will match an index name based on pattern and automatically apply the template. This is done by crafting a PUT call to the ElasticSearch '_template' endpoint with the specific template name. In short, the following mapping template is posted to &lt;code&gt;http://[ElasticSearch:9200]/_templates/syslog_template&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
        "template": "syslog-*",
        "mappings": {
            "syslog": {
                "properties": {
                    "@@timestamp": {
                        "type": "date",
                        "format": "strict_date_optional_time||epoch_millis"
                    },
                    "@@version": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "destination_address": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "destination_host": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "destination_port": {
                        "type": "integer"
                    },
                    "host": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "message": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "protocol": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "source_address": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "source_mac": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "index" : "not_analyzed"
                    },
                    "source_port": {
                        "type": "integer"
                    },
                    "syslog_pri": {
                        "type": "integer"
                    },
                    "syslog_timestamp": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "tags": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "type": {
                        "type": "string"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in place I need to delete todays syslog index so that it is recreated, using the mapping above, when the first syslog message is received. Once this has been done, the visualization looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-AccessByDestinationHostNotAnalysedVisualization.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Access By Destination Host Not-Analysed Visualization"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I showed how to display host names for accessed servers rather than IP addresses. I also covered how to update ElasticSearch mapping such that field 'analysis' can be prevented and host names kept together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, I'll show how to translate local device IP addresses in to device names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a firm believer in the notion "&lt;a href="http://slides.com/robwormald/everything-is-a-stream#/" title="Everything is a stream - Rob Wormald"&gt;Everything&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754" title="The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing - andrestaltz"&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://weareadaptive.com/blog/2014/05/05/everything-is-a-stream/" title="Reactive Trader 2: Everything is a Stream - Matt Barrett"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://colintheshots.com/blog/?p=85" title="Be Reactive - Colintheshots"&gt;stream&lt;/a&gt;". After all, at it's root what is a computer program but a stream of instructions toggling the state of transistors on the CPU die. As such, I have been gradually moving away from traditional imperative coding and embracing a declarative approach to implementing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the UI, my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/Caliburn.Micro.Reactive.Extensions" title="Caliburn.Micro.Reactive.Extensions Github Repository"&gt;Reactive Extensions for Caliburn Micro&lt;/a&gt; allowed me to escape the scourge of state variables and property change non-sense and have read-model changes update the view or user input changes update the view model in a declarative fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in place, I sort of stumbled onto a pattern I quite liked and gradually developed into a pattern I am now referring to as "Reactive Behaviors". To explain this pattern, lets take a basic example of a log in page for an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, in WPF MVVM parlance, the view model for the log in page might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class LogInPageViewModel : Screen, ILogInPageViewModel
{
    private readonly IAuthenticationService _authenticationService;

    private readonly DelegateCommand _logInCommand;
    private readonly DelegateCommand _cancelCommand;

    private CancellationTokenSource _cts;

    private string _username;
    private string _password;
    private string _error;

    public LogInPageViewModel(IAuthenticationService authenticationService)
    {
        _authenticationService = authenticationService;

        _cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
        _logInCommand = new DelegateCommand(CanLogIn, PerformLogIn);
        _cancelCommand = new DelegateCommand(_ =&amp;gt; true, CancelLogIn);
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (_cts != null)
        {
            _cts.Cancel();
            _cts.Dispose();
            _cts = null;
        }
    }

    private bool CanLogIn(object parameter)
    {
        return (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(_username) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(_password));
    }

    private async void PerformLogIn(object parameter)
    {
        AuthenticationResponse response = await _authenticationService.AuthenticateAsync(new AuthenticationRequest(_username, _password), _cts.Token);

        if (response.Successful)
        {
            TryClose(true);
        }
        else
        {
            Error = response.Error.Message;
        }
    }

    private void CancelLogIn(object parameter)
    {
        TryClose(false);
    }

    public string Username
    {
        get { return _username; }
        set
        {
            if (!string.Equals(value, _username))
            {
                _username = value;

                NotifyOfPropertyChange(() =&amp;gt; Username);

                _logInCommand.RaiseCanExecuteChanged();
            }
        }
    }

    public string Password
    {
        get { return _password; }
        set
        {
            if (!string.Equals(value, _password))
            {
                _password = value;

                NotifyOfPropertyChange(() =&amp;gt; Password);

                _logInCommand.RaiseCanExecuteChanged();
            }
        }
    }

    public string Error
    {
        get { return _error; }
        private set
        {
            if (!string.Equals(value, _error))
            {
                _error = value;

                NotifyOfPropertyChange(() =&amp;gt; Error);
            }
        }
    }

    public ICommand LogInCommand
    {
        get { return _logInCommand; }
    }
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, we have a bunch of state variables that are updated from property setters and when certain state variables are updated we need to perform specific actions. Now, can you quickly identify all the behaviors of this view model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's not a complicated view model so it'll probably just take a few minutes to work out the behaviors. To summarize, they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the user has entered a value in both the user name and password text boxes then enable the "Log in" button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the user clicks the "Log in" button, asynchronously attempt to log in with the supplied credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a successful login attempt is made, close the dialog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an unsuccessful login attempt is made, display an error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the user clicks the "Cancel" button, close the dialog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that took a few minutes of scanning back and forth over the class right? Also, while we have been good developers and applied DRY by centralizing the logic to determine when the log in button should be enabled, in order to know under what circumstances the logic will be called, we need to perform a "Find References" on the method. The cause and effect of this behavior are &lt;strong&gt;disassociated&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, in this instance it's event worse, as this method is only passed to the &lt;code&gt;DelegateCommand&lt;/code&gt; instance, we have to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that the &lt;code&gt;DelegateCommand&lt;/code&gt; will invoke this method everytime the &lt;code&gt;RaiseCanExecuteChanged&lt;/code&gt; is called &lt;em&gt;and then&lt;/em&gt; perform another "Find References" to find all the locations &lt;code&gt;RaiseCanExecuteChanged&lt;/code&gt; is called. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be better if we could somehow centralize this logic in discreet methods with names that describe exactly the behavior of the class? Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the same class re-written using "Reactive Behaviors":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class LogInPageViewModel : Screen, ILogInPageViewModel
{
    private readonly IAuthenticationService _authenticationService;

    private ObservableProperty&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; _username;
    private ObservableProperty&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; _password;
    private ObservableProperty&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; _error;
    private ObservableCommand _logInCommand;
    private ObservableCommand _cancelCommand;

    private Subject&amp;lt;AuthenticationResponse&amp;gt; _logInResponse;

    private IDisposable _behaviors;

    public LogInPageViewModel(IAuthenticationService authenticationService)
    {
        _authenticationService = authenticationService;

        _username = new ObservableProperty&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;(this, () =&amp;gt; Username);
        _password = new ObservableProperty&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;(this, () =&amp;gt; Password);
        _error = new ObservableProperty&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;(this, () =&amp;gt; Error);
        _logInCommand = new ObservableCommand();
        _cancelCommand = new ObservableCommand();

        _logInResponse = new Subject&amp;lt;AuthenticationResponse&amp;gt;();

        _behaviors = new CompositeDisposable(
            WhenTheUserHasEnteredBothUsernameAndPasswordThenEnableLogInButton(),
            WhenTheUserClicksTheLogInButtonAttemptToLogIn(),
            WhenASuccessfulLogInAttemptIsMadeCloseTheDialog(),
            WhenAnUnsuccessfulLogInAttemptIsMadeDisplayTheError(),
            WhenTheUserClicksTheCancelButtonCloseTheDialog()
        );
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (_behaviors != null)
        {
            _behaviors.Dispose();
            _behaviors = null;
        }
    }

    private IDisposable WhenTheUserHasEnteredBothUsernameAndPasswordThenEnableLogInButton()
    {
        return Observable
            .CombineLatest(_username, _password, (username, password) =&amp;gt; !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(username) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(password))
            .Subscribe(_logInCommand);
    }

    private IDisposable WhenTheUserClicksTheLogInButtonAttemptToLogIn()
    {
        return _logInCommand
            .SelectMany(_ =&amp;gt; Observable.CombineLatest(_username, _password, (username, password) =&amp;gt; new AuthenticationRequest(username, password)).Take(1))
            .SelectMany(request =&amp;gt; _authenticationService.AuthenticateAsync(request))
            .Subscribe(_logInResponse);
    }

    private IDisposable WhenASuccessfulLogInAttemptIsMadeCloseTheDialog()
    {
        return _logInResponse
            .Where(response =&amp;gt; response.Successful)
            .Subscribe(response =&amp;gt; TryClose(true));
    }

    private IDisposable WhenAnUnsuccessfulLogInAttemptIsMadeDisplayTheError()
    {
        return _logInResponse
            .Where(response =&amp;gt; !response.Successful)
            .Select(response =&amp;gt; response.Error.Message)
            .Subscribe(_error);
    }

    private IDisposable WhenTheUserClicksTheCancelButtonCloseTheDialog()
    {
        return _cancelCommand
            .Subscribe(_ =&amp;gt; TryClose(false));
    }

    public string Username
    {
        get { return _username.Get(); }
        set { _username.Set(value); }
    }

    public string Password
    {
        get { return _password.Get(); }
        set { _password.Set(value); }
    }

    public string Error
    {
        get { return _error.Get(); }
    }

    public ICommand LogInCommand
    {
        get { return _logInCommand; }
    }

    public ICommand CancelCommand
    {
        get { return _cancelCommand; }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown, the constructor instantiates a &lt;code&gt;CompositeDisposable&lt;/code&gt; containing calls to methods implementing the behavior of the class and which return an &lt;code&gt;IDisposable&lt;/code&gt; that, when disposed, will tear down the behavior. Each method is named after exactly one desired behavior and comprises a subscription to all the required inputs for the behavior, a series of projections which implement the behavior and, finally, a subscription which surfaces the result of the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets take the example of the &lt;code&gt;WhenTheUserHasEnteredBothUsernameAndPasswordThenEnableLogInButton&lt;/code&gt; method. Here we subscribe to both the &lt;code&gt;_username&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_password&lt;/code&gt; properties, and use a selector function to return a boolean indicating whether they're both populated. The &lt;code&gt;_logInCommand&lt;/code&gt; subscribes to the result which will enable or disable the command (by raising CanExecuteChanged events) appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, by leveraging Observables we become thread safe. It doesn't matter on which thread the source properties are updated from, the behavior will be performed and output applied without the risk of missing values or race-conditions between updates to the appropriate inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With behaviors implemented in this fashion, behavioral unit testing becomes incredibly obvious. Simply copy the behavior method names into your test fixture and assert that it performs as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this pattern provides numerous benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promotes behavior driven development and unit testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promotes functional and thread safe programming practises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces the risk of (and if done well, can eliminate) side effects as specific behaviors are isolated in a single well named method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stops 'code rot' as all behavior is encapsulated within specifically named methods. Want new behaviour? Add a new method. Don't want a specific behavior anymore? Just removed it. Want a specific behavior to change? Change the one method and know that you haven't broken anything else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides concise mechanisms for aggregating multiple inputs and promotes asynchronous processes to first-class status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces the need for utility classes as data can be passed through the pipeline as strongly typed anonymous classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevents memory leaks as all behaviors return a disposable that when disposed removes all subscriptions and disposed all managed resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this example targets the UI and leverages Caliburn Micro with Reactive Extensions for projection to IObservable&lt;t&gt; instances (and property change notification), this pattern can be employed across any class which treats inputs and outputs as a stream.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been employing this pattern very successfully across a variety of functional layers for quite some time now. I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finding a framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have recently found myself with a need to dive into the depths of modern web-development and, as I am currently looking to write a highly interactive single-page web application, the first thing to decide on was a client side framework to use. You won't have to read too many of my blog posts to realise that I'm a big fan of &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx?f=255&amp;amp;MSPPError=-2147217396"&gt;Rx&lt;/a&gt;. I am also keen on the MVVM approach to separating concerns when writing user interfaces. Therefore, during my research of modern web UI frameworks, I was extremely interested when I came across &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/"&gt;WebRx&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billed as "a browser-based MVVM-Framework that combines functional-reactive programming with declarative Data-Binding, Templating and Client-Side Routing" it struck a chord with my UI development style. In fact, it elevates &lt;a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html"&gt;Observables&lt;/a&gt; to a first class concept in a manner eerily similar to the ObservableProperty/ObservableCommand classes I wrote for my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/Caliburn.Micro.Reactive.Extensions"&gt;Caliburn.Micro.Reactive.Extensions&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as a framework, WebRx seems to be struggling to achieve critical mass and therefore there was very limited information available when I decided to attempt to implement the &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;WebRx "Hello World"&lt;/a&gt; example using Visual Studio. As is almost par for the course when using a new framework, I fell at a frustratingly early hurdle and, given the lack of info (seriously, only one tagged post on &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webrx"&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;!), I had to work through the problem 'old-skool'... ya'know, by actually finding and solving the problem rather than just googling a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought I'd put together a post outlining how to get started with this framework in Visual Studio in an attempt to start addressing the lack of info regarding this promising framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The name is Bart Simpson&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than the traditional 'Hello World' app, WebRx's 'Getting Started' guide displays a page stating 'The name is Bart Simpson'. This is done in order to demonstrates the MVVM separation of concerns through the use of a view bound to an underlying view model which provides the name 'Bart Simpson'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't intend to cover the entirety of the getting started guide here, merely the additional/different steps needed to get the project work from Visual Studio. As such, I suggest &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;opening the guide&lt;/a&gt; in a browser and leaving it open while working through the steps below as I will be referring to it extensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, open Visual Studio. Pretty much any modern version is fine, I am using Visual Studio 2015 Professional. Start a new project and select 'ASP.NET Web Application'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/NewAspWebApplication.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="New ASP.NET Web Application"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following dialog, select an empty ASP.NET Template and click ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/EmptyAsp452Project.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Empty ASP.NET Template"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a web project, lets add a reference to WebRx. This can be done using either the Package Manager Console using the command &lt;code&gt;Install-Package WebRx&lt;/code&gt; or via the visual Nuget package manager as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/InstallWebRxPackage.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:66%; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Install WebRx Package"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you add the reference to WebRx, you will be asked whether you wish to 'Search for TypeScript Typings' as shown below. Just click 'Yes'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/AddTypeScriptTypings.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:300px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Add TypeScript Typings"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also be prompted to accept the license aggrement for a number of RxJs packages which WebRx depends upon; you should accept these too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One the reference is added, you should find that a Scripts directory has been added to your solution and which contains a number of 'ts' and 'js' files for both WebRx and RxJs. With this in place, we can then continue with the getting started guide by adding an 'index.html' file to the project and copy pasting the sample 'index.html' file from the WebRx &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;getting started guide&lt;/a&gt;. It should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/CopyPasteIndexFromGettingStarted.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:400px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Copy Paste Index From Getting Started"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the eagle-eyed amongst you will notice three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our scripts are now in a 'bower_modules' directory&lt;br&gt;
As we used Nuget and not bower to install our WebRx dependencies, the script references should be changed to refer to the Scripts directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our scripts directory does not contain a rx.all.js file.&lt;br&gt;
For some reason, WebRx depends on a version of RxJs that does not include an rx.all.js file. To resolve this, simply upgrade to the latest version of RxJs-All, as shown below:
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/UpgradeRxJsAll.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Upgrade RxJs All"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't have a 'js' folder containing an 'app.js' file.&lt;br&gt;
Because we've not got to that bit yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now add a 'js' folder to the solution and add a 'app.js' to it. In this file copy the full 'app.js' sample from the WebRx  &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;getting started guide&lt;/a&gt; as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wx.app.component('hello', {
  viewModel: function() {
    this.firstName = 'Bart';
    this.lastName = 'Simpson';
  },
  template: 'The name is &amp;lt;span data-bind="text: firstName + \' \' + lastName"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;'
});

wx.router.state({
  name: "$",
  views: { 'main': "hello" }
});

wx.router.reload();

wx.applyBindings();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save all, set 'index.html' as the start page and hit F5. If everything went as planned you should now see 'The name is Bart Simpson' displayed in your default browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/TheNameIsBartSimpson.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:400px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="The Name Is Bart Simpson"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it. While the getting started example doesn't seem very complex, it does show a separation of view and view model. I'm very much looking forward to digging into the details of this very promising framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/BlogProjects/tree/master/WebRxWithAsp4"&gt;completed project&lt;/a&gt; for this post can be found in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/BlogProjects"&gt;BlogProjects repository&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>UWP Community Toolkit v1.1 Released</title>
		<updated>2016-10-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>
                                        


&lt;p&gt;Shortly after my blog post about &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/UsingHyperlinkInMVVM"&gt;Using a Hyperlink in MVVM&lt;/a&gt; a group of developers at Microsoft collated and released the &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/08/17/introducing-the-uwp-community-toolkit/#pRVgJbZbTBMHPyGG.97"&gt;UWP Community Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. They were actively asking for contributions and, given the self contained nature of the Hyperlink extension, it seemed like a natural fit for the toolkit so I decided to try contributing it via pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toolkit's contribution guidelines and conventions closely matched my own coding style so I had to change very little of the code in my article but did have to add XML summary blocks to each public class and members. With that done I could add the class to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/UWPCommunityToolkit/tree/dev/Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp/Helpers"&gt;Helpers folder on the dev branch of my fork of the toolkit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/pull/226"&gt;issue a pull request&lt;/a&gt;. I was also asked to produce some documentation and a sample for the class which was then pulled into the document repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest, as they say, is history. &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/10/05/announcing-uwp-community-toolkit-1-1/#1QBL3lQjtLbY537i.97"&gt;Version 1.1 of the toolkit released&lt;/a&gt; with yours truly in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/releases/"&gt;list of contributors&lt;/a&gt;. It's a small contribution but I really think the toolkit is a promising project and absolutely intend to contribute further in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, well done to all the maintainers of, and contributors to, the toolkit on this important milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Shortly after my blog post about &lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/UsingHyperlinkInMVVM"&gt;Using a Hyperlink in MVVM&lt;/a&gt; a group of developers at Microsoft collated and released the &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/08/17/introducing-the-uwp-community-toolkit/#pRVgJbZbTBMHPyGG.97"&gt;UWP Community Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. They were actively asking for contributions and, given the self contained nature of the Hyperlink extension, it seemed like a natural fit for the toolkit so I decided to try contributing it via pull request.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ToddlerBox has been in the store less than two weeks and, despite very little in the way of promotion (my other half sent out a call on Facebook for beta users), it has somehow accumulated over a thousand installs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisitions have seen steady growth across a (more or less) expected demographic as can be seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://zphbkg.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y3mxlql02_eOqhCIiHNom5uhtzjCe_ZMvbgIGPcUuLMbuHi_cmFRtGpAIb2CVV_k_HAO6v_3BB7AfILc428eEqv96IXFv3b-Vwws3CvDkXxj9uTiBtz9C2JTxwcKIPHpbhXb1LSnjCUDMosCL5GbtEQN9PsjnFM4iq6n2cCuMcSAVo?width=660&amp;amp;height=145&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:660px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Acquisitions over App Lifetime"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://0ohtkg.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y3mJ-gCk99nTK8OuY5w0Ws1xjrRZiFLkxZMpJ-0LWENyYp0q9h-tnT73xZC4_a-hrF4rbBao7kp7vY7jrdgON0ukq9qib82QSM6vNHTvQwvTUYPfyFnfOviJ0HWYe_JRsunQODVyvcmOh0zjjzDk1LXL13blrvuAloFWFlFIFygSSQ?width=660&amp;amp;height=235&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:660px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Acquisitions by Demographic"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the number of users, the number of countries it is being used in has been really surprising. Sure, there's no localization concerns so there's no reason it &lt;em&gt;wouldn't&lt;/em&gt; be used in non-English speaking countries but I'm genuinely pleased to see it being used all over the world; from USA to Saudi Arabia and from Canada to China! Here's the current breakdown of usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Sessions&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;United States&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;910&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;311&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Canada&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;110&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Australia&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;42&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;33&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;China &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Brazil&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mexico&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Germany&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Netherlands&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;France&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;New Zealand&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ireland&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Latvia&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Hungary&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sweden&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Russia&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Poland&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Slovakia &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;South Africa&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Austria&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Belgium&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Switzerland&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Spain &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Guam&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chile &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Denmark&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Romania&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Colombia &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Italy &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Libya &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Norway&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;United Arab Emirates &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the somewhat unexpected success of ToddlerBox I am planning to release a number of future versions with various enhancements and new interactions/visualizations for toddler's to mash away at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All good fun :0D&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Dart web development with Visual Studio Code</title>
		<updated>2017-01-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>
                                        


&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Code is rapidly becoming my go-to editor for anything not project-oriented C#/F#. I've switched from &lt;a href="https://atom.io/"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="(https://code.visualstudio.com/)"&gt;VSC&lt;/a&gt; for editing my (&lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/NewBlogUsingWyam"&gt;statically-generated, Markdown driven&lt;/a&gt;) blog and have used it for authoring powershell scripts, dockerfiles and much, much more. So, when I decided I wanted to write some &lt;a href="https://www.dartlang.org/"&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt; code, it was the obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Dart?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I decide on Dart? Well, I had project I wanted to undertake that featured some... shock horror... dynamic web content. If that isn't enough to send chills down your spine, you've either &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.fqoett4pt"&gt;never had to look at getting started with modern web development&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@pistacchio/i-m-a-web-developer-and-i-ve-been-stuck-with-the-simplest-app-for-the-last-10-days-fb5c50917df#.glf30ovv1"&gt;you've already drunk the cool-aid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, most rational people in the industry will (in the moments of clarity between writing off the last framework as dated and evangelising the next) reluctantly admit that &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@wob/the-sad-state-of-web-development-1603a861d29f#.lqu2r4xup"&gt;modern web development is a mess&lt;/a&gt;. But this is the world we live in and the best one can do is dodge the analysis paralysis and mitigate the majority of the risks. For me, this was adopting a &lt;a href="https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/language-tour"&gt;strongly-typed modern development language&lt;/a&gt; that has a &lt;a href="https://webdev.dartlang.org/"&gt;strong web pedegry&lt;/a&gt; and just get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But in Visual Studio Code?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not? It's a great editor and already has great support for Dart courtesy of Danny Tuppeny's &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanTup.DartVS-VisualStudiosupportforGooglesDart"&gt;excellent Dart extension&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, I try to keep my development machine as lean and clean as possible so I didn't want to have to &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/"&gt;install an IDE specifically for Dart development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, as you'll see, getting set up for Dart development with Visual Studio Code is very easy, doesn't require any installation (everything is "xcopy" deployed) and you can start being productive almost right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/Download"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; - obviously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanTup.dart-code"&gt;DartVS&lt;/a&gt; - the Dart language extension for Visual Studio Code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/stable/release/1.21.0/sdk/dartsdk-windows-x64-release.zip"&gt;The Dart SDK&lt;/a&gt; - the code Dart binaries and tools needed for dart development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/stable/release/latest/dartium/dartium-windows-ia32-release.zip"&gt;Dartium&lt;/a&gt; - a version of Chrome (even called "Chrome.exe") with a built in Dart runtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and extract the Dart SDK to a location on your HD (I use &lt;code&gt;C:\Apps&lt;/code&gt; for "manually" installed tools/applications so will be using the path &lt;code&gt;C:\Apps\dart-sdk&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and extract Dartium to a location on your HD (&lt;code&gt;C:\Apps\chromium&lt;/code&gt; for me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new directory wherever you keep your source files and name it &lt;code&gt;GettingStartedWithDart&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this directory, create two further directories named &lt;code&gt;lib&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; (this structure follows the &lt;a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/package-layout"&gt;Pub Package Layout Conventions&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Visual Studio Code and open the &lt;code&gt;GettingStartedWithDart&lt;/code&gt; folder. You should see something like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src="https://plt6eg-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3m_WQkZhj4Xo-vjZzyUVujyGYAM3lM7Gs84uuf59zCfPKJQzrT9d--PF8Ns9Gwm3qluxzW26f_H9OU5PZQEq37lEKy9aKY553bzGzZLNU_CBIRGUWA_9_QbE-a0WgQz284pvZY2-Voc83pjQc2h9iMUIzap8At--sCEdhJXyO6sXw?width=660&amp;amp;height=497&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:800; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Empty Project"&gt;
&lt;ol start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you haven't already, install the DartVS extension by hitting &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Shift-X&lt;/code&gt; (the keyboard shortcut for "View-&amp;gt;Extensions") and type Dart in the search box. This should show the "Dart Code" extension by "Danny Tuppeny". Click install and reload the window when complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we haven't elected to add the Dart SDK to the path, we need to tell the Dart extension where it can find the SDK. This is done by editing the User Settings (&lt;code&gt;File-&amp;gt;Preferences-&amp;gt;User Settings&lt;/code&gt;) and adding the following settings:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    "dart.sdkPath": "C:\\Apps\\dart-sdk",
    "dart.debugSdkLibraries": false,
    "dart.debugExternalLibraries": false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start="8"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in the Explorer view (&lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Shift-E&lt;/code&gt;) add a new file to the &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; directory named &lt;code&gt;main.dart&lt;/code&gt;. We'll populate this file shortly but, for now, it's just so that VSC (and DartVS) realises that this is a Dart project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add another new file named &lt;code&gt;pubspec.yaml&lt;/code&gt; to the root directory. This file tells the Dart compiler (named &lt;code&gt;Pub&lt;/code&gt;) how to build your Dart project and follows a very &lt;a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/pubspec"&gt;simply format&lt;/a&gt;. In this file add &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dependencies&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt; as shown below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: GettingStartedWithDart
dependencies:
transformers:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start="10"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you save this file, you should see the &lt;code&gt;Output&lt;/code&gt; panel appear showing the output of the &lt;code&gt;Pub&lt;/code&gt; command. This is a feature of the DartVS extension which runs a &lt;code&gt;pub get&lt;/code&gt; command whenever you save the &lt;code&gt;pubspec.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file. As you can probably guess from the output (shown below) the purpose of this command is to retrieve/update any dependencies you've declared in the &lt;code&gt;dependencies&lt;/code&gt; section. Also, once the &lt;code&gt;pub get&lt;/code&gt; command has run, you should see a new &lt;code&gt;pubspec.lock&lt;/code&gt; file appear in the root directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src="https://plt5eg-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3mCavvhl_SorCHUuY_oZ01TMQ9jkjpMy_I48Eotp3TlC5s-TRU0JaznDIYoihtHpfFj6A3Aqwu9eEKDhOQaK7jnEO7g6UscYBqeBp5yLg_PnzxGgWQpVTwgrxkJeOw8EUet6KhgGEn2Lkm3IYfP4-K-SEXXvKT4G64DcweiAsnQ-k?width=660&amp;amp;height=497&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:800; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Get Dependencies"&gt;
&lt;ol start="11"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we're focusing on using Dart for web development, we'll also add an HTML document we'll manipulate using Dart. To do this, simply add new file named &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; directory and populate it with the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Getting Started With Dart&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script type="application/dart" src="main.dart"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1 id="header"&amp;gt;Hmm... what should I say?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start="12"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point you should have the following layout in your project and we're ready start start writing some Dart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;    [Source Directory]
    |-&amp;gt; [Project Name] (i.e. "GettingStartedWithDart")
    | | -&amp;gt; lib
    | | -&amp;gt; web
    | | | -&amp;gt; index.html
    | | | -&amp;gt; main.dart
    | | -&amp;gt; pubspec.lock
    | | -&amp;gt; pubspec.yaml
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start="13"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;main.dart&lt;/code&gt; file, add the following code. (Note, if you type this code rather than copy-pasting it, you'll notice the excellent intellisense features provided by VSC and implemented beautifully by Dart VS.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import 'dart:html';

void main() {
  querySelector('#header').text = 'Ah yes... Hello World!!!';
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start="14"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right, now we have an HTML file and some Dart code and we're ready to run. While you could run this code manually from the command line, if you're intending on doing more than just this getting started guide, I'd very much recommend setting up some task runners in VSC. This is done by opening the command palette (&lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Shift-P&lt;/code&gt;) and typing &lt;code&gt;Configure Task Runner&lt;/code&gt;, which should show you the command &lt;code&gt;Tasks: Configure Task Runner&lt;/code&gt;. Select this and you will see a list of build systems VSC can automatically create a task runner for (shown below). As Dart isn't one of the predefined templates, select "Others" to create an empty Tasks file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src="https://plt4eg-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3mjQOmP0yb0-3KfLb34MamSLnq13qKN0jSNcEHLMIOn7u2kbunZuaN74mec-0mquSOr05it5RZC6Uov1rnpiweb1sL6a96iKFJYLWC_6hSlldbQjHriAKAa71-k_8Dop-6iLRxL38BNzOMqii4VNZVfIlFgV_Ow2hG1GtMwXjB7A4?width=660&amp;amp;height=497&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:800; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Configure Task Runner"&gt;
&lt;ol start="15"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This command should create a new file called &lt;code&gt;tasks.json&lt;/code&gt; in a new &lt;code&gt;.vscode&lt;/code&gt; directory and will contain the following json.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "echo",
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "args": ["Hello World"],
    "showOutput": "always"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start="16"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're not familiar with configuring VSC task runners, I'd very much recommend clicking the link in this file to see what the task runner is able to do and how to configure it. However, for your convenience, I have provided my configuration below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "C:\\Apps\\dart-sdk\\bin\\pub.bat",
    "isShellCommand": true,
    "args": [],
    "showOutput": "always",
    "echoCommand": true,
    "tasks": [
        {
            "taskName": "build",
            "args": [],
            "isWatching": false
         },
        {
            "taskName": "serve",
            "args": [],
            "isWatching": true
         }
    ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start="17"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you will probably be able to determine, this file contains two tasks; one named &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; and the other named &lt;code&gt;serve&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; command compiles your code and checks for errors while the &lt;code&gt;serve&lt;/code&gt; command sets up a local web-server (by default bound to port 8080) capable of serving the content of the &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; directory. Lets try both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the command palette (&lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Shift-P&lt;/code&gt;), delete the '&amp;gt;' prompt and then type &lt;code&gt;task&lt;/code&gt; followed by a space. You should see the two tasks defined above appear. Continue to &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; and then hit return. At this point, the output pane should appear displaying the &lt;code&gt;Tasks&lt;/code&gt; output and your code should be compiled (and, transpiled into JS!). This is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src="https://plt3eg-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3ma_gmHNRQHH3HaNTz8ytRLamtMwlzmi0dRSYl1aqncp0Zy-RaUW_qLGOebg_PpgRdCoYLQYFcuRWZ3FC_Y6jJ0Qw6n5rWbGxvUMzi5_yqitbOf3DrJUVAkQi9Th0JvQmzLysrJGrnhrVe7Z2eYY6uUse_0o88veVTn8eYaIZsHnw?width=660&amp;amp;height=497&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:800; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Tasks and Build output"&gt;
&lt;ol start="19"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If everything is successful, you should see the message '&lt;code&gt;Built 2 files to "build"&lt;/code&gt;'. Now we can test our Dart code by serving it through &lt;code&gt;pub server&lt;/code&gt;. To do this, start the &lt;code&gt;task serve&lt;/code&gt; task in a similar manner to the &lt;code&gt;task build&lt;/code&gt; above. As this task is an &lt;code&gt;isWatching&lt;/code&gt; command, the task won't complete when run but will emit messages to the output pane when changes occur. This is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a local web-server serving out HTML file and Dart code, we can finally start to use Dartium to run the code. Note that, we're using Dartium because we'll be executing the Dart code directly (rather than the transpiled JavaScript) and Dartium has a built-in Dart runtime which allows for advanced debugging of our Dart code. Start Dartium but executing it from either command line or GUI (exists at &lt;code&gt;C:\Apps\chromium\chrome.exe&lt;/code&gt; for me) and, once started, navigate to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt; and you should see the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src="https://nbtqeg-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3m2wj9PACazah5vdBUyW8AOGu__v3AbjHyzU66QtsvCuHVA4Ya710e4bjVJv4GdNiXlige7q8waQcphwiH8FtLZG8eu-z7cOiBPi-vqx8KfgkYPvwVrtPIpJoCmdIDR8LmO8DIqkHSvNe6Kz5q65IoWi1DRivqqpX5YUET_9zEmS4?width=660&amp;amp;height=542&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:800; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Success!!"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you've just run your first Dart code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something went wrong and you don't see the header text change from 'Hmm... what should I say?' to 'Ah yes... Hello World!!!' then you can use Dartium's Developer Tools (&lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Shift-I&lt;/code&gt;) to view errors and add breakpoints so you can work out what has gone wrong. The developer tools are shown here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://nbtpeg-dm2306.files.1drv.com/y3my4JbT3bsQcqBOB3NANuaB-FMf_vBHNlAc1qm5QaXuFVEWxIV1YuoIj7gu-QJZtFOgS_gHJBknLl8J_LY9shZ_YtYf8Jf0BL9T0r4NMf3dv5XXvZt0x_J0IqZ7lurmX5MJP7oyA9FMO8oMkm29BAxoQI2jV-s6dyO2APv8dvXRTM?width=660&amp;amp;height=542&amp;amp;cropmode=none" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:800; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Dartium Developer Tools"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find loads more information online about the &lt;a href="https://www.dartlang.org/"&gt;Dart Language&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://webdev.dartlang.org/"&gt;Dart Web Development&lt;/a&gt;. Versions of Dart are changing rapidly (there was a minor update while writing this post!) and a thriving &lt;a href="https://www.dartlang.org/community"&gt;support community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a (mainly) C# developer I found Dart super easy to get up to speed with and the Visual Studio Code/Dartium combo to be extremely productive. Hopefully you will too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Code is rapidly becoming my go-to editor for anything not project-oriented C#/F#. I've switched from &lt;a href="https://atom.io/"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="(https://code.visualstudio.com/)"&gt;VSC&lt;/a&gt; for editing my (&lt;a href="http://ian.bebbs.co.uk/posts/NewBlogUsingWyam"&gt;statically-generated, Markdown driven&lt;/a&gt;) blog and have used it for authoring powershell scripts, dockerfiles and much, much more. So, when I decided I wanted to write some &lt;a href="https://www.dartlang.org/"&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt; code, it was the obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
	</entry>
</feed>iler to output the transpiled JavaScript files to the &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; folder where they can be used by the client browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should now have a &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; file that looks like this:
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "noEmitOnError": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "es5",
    "outDir": "js"
  },
  "exclude": [
    "Scripts",
    "wwwroot"
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;ts&lt;/code&gt; folder to the solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an &lt;code&gt;app.ts&lt;/code&gt; typescript file to the &lt;code&gt;ts&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add references to Rx and WebRx to the &lt;code&gt;app.ts&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
WebRx requires that you add an explicit reference to &lt;code&gt;rx.all.d.ts&lt;/code&gt; prior to the reference to &lt;code&gt;web.rx.d.ts&lt;/code&gt; in order for the Rx module to be brought into scope. The references should therefore be added like this:
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// &amp;lt;reference path="../Scripts/rx.all.d.ts"/&amp;gt;
/// &amp;lt;reference path="../Scripts/typings/web.rx.d.ts" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement view / view model code&lt;br&gt;
You can now re-implement the code from &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; as TypeScript virtually verbatim but do note how you get Intellisense for all the methods and properties of &lt;code&gt;wx&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix compilation error with call to &lt;code&gt;wx.applyBindings&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;wx.applyBindings&lt;/code&gt; method &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;code&gt;model&lt;/code&gt; parameter which, in JavaScript, is defaulted but in TypeScript causes a compilation error. To resolve this, simply pass an empty object to the method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;app.ts&lt;/code&gt; file should now look like this:
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/// &amp;lt;reference path="../Scripts/rx.all.d.ts"/&amp;gt;
/// &amp;lt;reference path="../Scripts/typings/web.rx.d.ts" /&amp;gt;

wx.app.component('hello', {
    viewModel: function () {
        this.firstName = 'Bart';
        this.lastName = 'Simpson';
    },
    template: 'The name is &amp;lt;span data-bind="text: firstName + \' \' + lastName"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;'
});

wx.router.state({
    name: "$",
    views: { 'main': "hello" }
});

wx.router.reload();

wx.applyBindings({});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile the project and include the generated &lt;code&gt;js/app.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;js/app.js.map&lt;/code&gt; files into the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit F5 and you should again see the message 'The name is Bart Simpson' displayed in your default browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you're now ready to develop your application using full Intellisense and in the comfort of the knowledge that the compiler (well, transpiler) will pick up any syntactic bugs you may inadvertently create.&lt;/p&gt;

</feed> StackOverflow Reputation accumulation across the year (light blue line) with gains shown day-by-day (dark blue boxes). While I predominantly consider it a distraction, I really enjoy answering questions on StackOverflow, probably due to the awesome &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification"&gt;gamification&lt;/a&gt; employed on the &lt;a href="http://stackexchange.com/"&gt;StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a low level of fairly constant reputation gain, most of the gains came in short bursts. As discussed above, I attribute this losing focus on my main projects due to inactivity. Still, there are far worse forms of procrastination than helping people and I consider this a relatively good use of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently endeavoring to get the 'Fanatic' badge (visit StackOverflow for 100 days consecutively) but trying not to let it get in the way of other work. This usually means only answering questions when I can quickly point the asker in the right direction but I will occasionally field a more challenging question when it's &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/system.reactive"&gt;something I'm particularly interested in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blog posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the year I have written and published 22 blog posts - totaling nearly 24,000 words - across a range of subjects including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D PRINTING (1) APACHE KAFKA (1) APACHE ZOOKEEPER (1) ATTACHED PROPERTY (1) BDD (1) BEHAVIORAL (1) BLOG (3) CAREER BREAK (1) CLIENT-SIDE FRAMEWORK (2) CQRS (1) DART (1) DATAFLOW (1) DOCKER (1) DVD RIPPING (1) EF (1) ELASTIC STACK (4) ELASTICSEARCH (4) EVENT SOURCING (1) EVENTS (1) EVENTSOURCING (1) FUTURE (1) GITHUB (2) GROWTH (1) HYPERLINK (1) IOT (1) JAVASCRIPT (2) JS (1) KIBANA (4) LITTLELITTLE (1) LOGSTASH (4) MAPLIN (1) MONITORING (4) MVVM (1) NANOSERVER (1) NETWORKING (4) PARENTHOOD (1) PATTERNS (1) PRODUCTIVITY (1) RASPBERRYPI (1) REACTIVE (7) REST (1) ROBOX (1) RX (7) SQL (1) STATE MACHINES (1) SVG (1) SYSLOG (4) TESTING (1) TODDLERBOX (3) TOOLKIT (2) TPL (2) TRAVEL (1) TYPESCRIPT (1) UWP (7) VISUAL STUDIO (2) VISUAL STUDIO CODE (1) WEBRX (2) WINDOWS SERVER 2016 (1) WYAM (1) XAML (2) XBOX (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This content garners an average of around 110 unique visitors and 400 page views every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these posts - &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/07/the-week-in-net-972016/"&gt;"The absolute easiest way to use SVG icons in UWP apps"&lt;/a&gt; was featured in &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/07/the-week-in-net-972016/"&gt;"The week in .NET – 9/7/2016"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in, I think I've added some valuable content to my blog this last year but feel like I should have tried harder to increase it's reach. While writing these blog posts inevitably takes a considerably amount of time, I intend to continue making as many new posts as possible, hopefully across an increased range of subjects and - by submitting to various aggregation blogs - with increased readership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commitments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This timeline displays any days I had expected to work yet was unable to for a variety of reasons. Over the course of the year this accounted for 42 days, mostly the Thursdays that have become my "daddy-day-care" day and during which I take my daughter swimming. While these "commitments" would have been worked around had I been in full-time employment, the flexibility of working when I can as opposed to when I have to has undoubtedly led to a greater degree of motiviation and concentration when I am in front of the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

Being able to fabricate components I previously had to hack together from off the shelf bits is tremendously empowering and I can unashamedly say that I am completely hooked on 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while I have no direct experience of other 3D printers, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend CEL's Robox printer as - despite still failing the nozzle calibration - it has yet to fail a print and the software is remarkably straight forward and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finding a framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have recently found myself with a need to dive into the depths of modern web-development and, as I am currently looking to write a highly interactive single-page web application, the first thing to decide on was a client side framework to use. You won't have to read too many of my blog posts to realise that I'm a big fan of &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx?f=255&amp;amp;MSPPError=-2147217396"&gt;Rx&lt;/a&gt;. I am also keen on the MVVM approach to separating concerns when writing user interfaces. Therefore, during my research of modern web UI frameworks, I was extremely interested when I came across &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/"&gt;WebRx&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billed as "a browser-based MVVM-Framework that combines functional-reactive programming with declarative Data-Binding, Templating and Client-Side Routing" it struck a chord with my UI development style. In fact, it elevates &lt;a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html"&gt;Observables&lt;/a&gt; to a first class concept in a manner eerily similar to the ObservableProperty/ObservableCommand classes I wrote for my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/Caliburn.Micro.Reactive.Extensions"&gt;Caliburn.Micro.Reactive.Extensions&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as a framework, WebRx seems to be struggling to achieve critical mass and therefore there was very limited information available when I decided to attempt to implement the &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;WebRx "Hello World"&lt;/a&gt; example using Visual Studio. As is almost par for the course when using a new framework, I fell at a frustratingly early hurdle and, given the lack of info (seriously, only one tagged post on &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webrx"&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;!), I had to work through the problem 'old-skool'... ya'know, by actually finding and solving the problem rather than just googling a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought I'd put together a post outlining how to get started with this framework in Visual Studio in an attempt to start addressing the lack of info regarding this promising framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The name is Bart Simpson&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than the traditional 'Hello World' app, WebRx's 'Getting Started' guide displays a page stating 'The name is Bart Simpson'. This is done in order to demonstrates the MVVM separation of concerns through the use of a view bound to an underlying view model which provides the name 'Bart Simpson'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't intend to cover the entirety of the getting started guide here, merely the additional/different steps needed to get the project work from Visual Studio. As such, I suggest &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;opening the guide&lt;/a&gt; in a browser and leaving it open while working through the steps below as I will be referring to it extensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, open Visual Studio. Pretty much any modern version is fine, I am using Visual Studio 2015 Professional. Start a new project and select 'ASP.NET Web Application'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/NewAspWebApplication.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="New ASP.NET Web Application"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following dialog, select an empty ASP.NET Template and click ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/EmptyAsp452Project.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Empty ASP.NET Template"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a web project, lets add a reference to WebRx. This can be done using either the Package Manager Console using the command &lt;code&gt;Install-Package WebRx&lt;/code&gt; or via the visual Nuget package manager as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/InstallWebRxPackage.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:66%; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Install WebRx Package"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you add the reference to WebRx, you will be asked whether you wish to 'Search for TypeScript Typings' as shown below. Just click 'Yes'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/AddTypeScriptTypings.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:300px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Add TypeScript Typings"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also be prompted to accept the license aggrement for a number of RxJs packages which WebRx depends upon; you should accept these too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One the reference is added, you should find that a Scripts directory has been added to your solution and which contains a number of 'ts' and 'js' files for both WebRx and RxJs. With this in place, we can then continue with the getting started guide by adding an 'index.html' file to the project and copy pasting the sample 'index.html' file from the WebRx &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;getting started guide&lt;/a&gt;. It should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/CopyPasteIndexFromGettingStarted.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:400px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Copy Paste Index From Getting Started"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the eagle-eyed amongst you will notice three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our scripts are now in a 'bower_modules' directory&lt;br&gt;
As we used Nuget and not bower to install our WebRx dependencies, the script references should be changed to refer to the Scripts directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our scripts directory does not contain a rx.all.js file.&lt;br&gt;
For some reason, WebRx depends on a version of RxJs that does not include an rx.all.js file. To resolve this, simply upgrade to the latest version of RxJs-All, as shown below:
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/UpgradeRxJsAll.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Upgrade RxJs All"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't have a 'js' folder containing an 'app.js' file.&lt;br&gt;
Because we've not got to that bit yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now add a 'js' folder to the solution and add a 'app.js' to it. In this file copy the full 'app.js' sample from the WebRx  &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;getting started guide&lt;/a&gt; as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wx.app.component('hello', {
  viewModel: function() {
    this.firstName = 'Bart';
    this.lastName = 'Simpson';
  },
  template: 'The name is &amp;lt;span data-bind="text: firstName + \' \' + lastName"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;'
});

wx.router.state({
  name: "$",
  views: { 'main': "hello" }
});

wx.router.reload();

wx.applyBindings();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save all, set 'index.html' as the start page and hit F5. If everything went as planned you should now see 'The name is Bart Simpson' displayed in your default browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/RxWeb/TheNameIsBartSimpson.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:400px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="The Name Is Bart Simpson"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it. While the getting started example doesn't seem very complex, it does show a separation of view and view model. I'm very much looking forward to digging into the details of this very promising framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/BlogProjects/tree/master/WebRxWithAsp4"&gt;completed project&lt;/a&gt; for this post can be found in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/BlogProjects"&gt;BlogProjects repository&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, during my research of modern web UI frameworks, I was extremely interested when I came across &lt;a href="http://webrxjs.org/"&gt;WebRx&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;In the last post, I used the Logstash &lt;code&gt;dns&lt;/code&gt; filter to translate remote server IP addresses into recognisable domain names. In this post, I will look to perform a similar operation for local IP addresses in order to translate them into recognisable device names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;translating local ip addresses to device names&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the last post we could use the &lt;code&gt;dns&lt;/code&gt; filter to perform a reverse dns lookup to resolve a remote domain name for an IP address, this is not possible with local IP addresses. Fortunately, I have two key tools that I can use to perform a similar operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While my router behaves as a DHCP server, it has a feature that allows it to always allocate the same IP address to a given MAC address. Therefore I know a given device will always have a specific IP address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logstash provides the &lt;code&gt;translate&lt;/code&gt; filter which allows you to map from one value to another via a dictionary lookup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my routers "Bind IP to MAC" function set up, I will author a new &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt; file that meets the specifications outlined in the &lt;code&gt;translate&lt;/code&gt; filter &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-translate.html#plugins-filters-translate-destination"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.1.3: TPLink Range Extender
192.168.1.9: Ricoh Printer
192.168.1.10: Server A
192.168.1.21: PC A
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll name this file &lt;code&gt;IPLookup.yaml&lt;/code&gt; and save it besides the &lt;code&gt;syslog.config&lt;/code&gt; file. Next I need to add additional filters to &lt;code&gt;syslog.config&lt;/code&gt; which now looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;input {
  tcp {
    port =&amp;gt; 5000
    type =&amp;gt; syslog
  }
  udp {
    port =&amp;gt; 5000
    type =&amp;gt; syslog
  }
}

filter {
    grok {
        match =&amp;gt; [ "message", "&amp;lt;%{POSINT:syslog_pri}&amp;gt;%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp} Vigor\: Local User \(MAC=%{MAC:source_mac}\): %{IP:source_address}(?::%{POSINT:source_port})? -&amp;gt; %{IP:destination_address}(?::%{POSINT:destination_port})? \((?&amp;lt;protocol&amp;gt;TCP|UDP)\)" ]
        add_tag =&amp;gt; "access"
    }
    if "access" in [tags] {
        mutate {
            add_field =&amp;gt; {
              "source_host" =&amp;gt; "%{[source_address]}"
              "destination_host" =&amp;gt; "%{[destination_address]}"
            }
        }
        dns {
            reverse =&amp;gt; [ "destination_host" ]
            action =&amp;gt; "replace"
            nameserver =&amp;gt; "192.168.1.1"
        }
        translate {
            destination =&amp;gt; "source_host"
            dictionary_path =&amp;gt; "config\IPLookup.yaml"
            fallback =&amp;gt; "%{source_address}"
            field =&amp;gt; "source_address"      
            override =&amp;gt; true   
        }
    }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts =&amp;gt; ["192.168.1.30:9200"]
    index =&amp;gt; "syslog-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the &lt;code&gt;translate&lt;/code&gt; filter where I lookup the &lt;code&gt;source_address&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;code&gt;IPLookup.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file and put the result in the &lt;code&gt;source_host&lt;/code&gt; field. If not found, the &lt;code&gt;fallback&lt;/code&gt; value instructs the filter to output the &lt;code&gt;source_address&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;source_host&lt;/code&gt; field. The &lt;code&gt;override&lt;/code&gt; value is set to true as the &lt;code&gt;source_host&lt;/code&gt; field is added in the &lt;code&gt;mutate&lt;/code&gt; filter above as a fail-safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the changes to configuration in place, I once again restart Logstash. Once a syslog message has been received, I get the mapping from ElasticSearch and update it to mark the &lt;code&gt;local_host&lt;/code&gt; field as &lt;code&gt;not_analyzed&lt;/code&gt;. Then, in Kibana, I refresh the field list for the 'syslog-*' index, add 'local_host' to the 'Syslog Messages' saved search, load 'Access By Local Address' visualization and modify it to use 'local_host' rather than the 'local_address' field and save it as 'Access By Local Host'. Finally, I replace this visualization on my dashboard and get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-DashboardWithAccessByLocalHost.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Dashboard With Access By Local Host"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;further mappings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I've got the translation of local IP addresses to names working, I'm going to add a few more translations for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP Address to Operating System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP Address to Wired/WiFi connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TCP and UDP Port to Protocol (using a &lt;a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml"&gt;CSV from IANA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these in place, the dashboard is starting to come together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-DashboardWithLocalPortAndOsLookups.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Dashboard With Local Port And Os Lookups"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I showed how to display local device names rather than IP addresses by using LogStash's &lt;code&gt;translate&lt;/code&gt; filter. I then used this filter to provide further information about local device and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, I'll show how to add some variation to the dashboard by mapping destination locations.&lt;/p&gt;

</feed>ram' as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-VisualiseDateHistogram.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Visualise Date Histogram"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these settings in place, click the 'Apply Changes' button and you should immediately see a chart of the count of syslog messages over time. Note that Kibana has automatically selected an appropriate resolution of column grouping (messages 'per 30 seconds' in the example above) but that this can be changed later if required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, we want to add this chart to a new dashboard so we can have it available to us at a moments notice. To do this, we first save our visualization by clicking the 'Save Visuaization' button as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-VisualiseSaveSyslogMessagesOverTime.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Visualise Save Syslog Messages Over Time"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we navigate to the 'Dashboard' tab and click the '+' button as prompted. Again, we selected the visualization we just saved as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-DashboardAddVisualization.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Dashboard Add Visualization"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the "Syslog Messages Over Time" visualization added, we make it a usable size by dragging the resize control (button right corner of the visualization) to extend the visualization across the width of the window as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-DashboardSizeVisualization.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Dashboard Size Visualization"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to make it easier to see the messages the histogram refers to, we'll add a table of related Syslog messages onto our dashboard below the histogram. To do this, click the '+' button, selected 'Searches' and then our 'Syslog Messages' search. When the table is added to the dashboard, make it a similar size as the histogram as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-DashboardWithSearch.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Dashboard With Search"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once done, we need to save the dashboard so we can reload it any time we need it. Simply click the 'Save Dashboard' button as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/Content/HomeNetworkMonitoring/Kibana-DashboardSaveSyslogMessages.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width:600px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" alt="Kibana Dashboard Save Syslog Messages"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once saved you can bookmark the page and get back to your dashboard any time you like. Furthermore, once saved, you can monkey with the dashboard (explore the data by highlighting various areas of the chart, change time frames, set autorefresh etc) as much as you like knowing you can return to saved version any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I have outlined how to use a Syslog capable router to send Syslog messages to Logstash and have Logstash store these messages in ElasticSearch for querying. Furthermore we then created a dashboard in which we can explore the number of Syslog messages we received over various timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post we'll increase the granularity of the messages we store so that we can start creating more interesting dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Home networks are becoming increasingly complex. It is no longer just geeks and techies who have pervasive WiFi through-out their home to which a myriad of devices connect and communicate. When things go wrong or, worse still, the network is compromised by rouge hardware or software it's extremely difficult to work out what has happened and where to start troubleshooting the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;h2&gt;Building the Kafka image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Zookeeper scripts as a pattern, it was ludicrously easy to script up another image for Kafka. Just a few changes to file names and configuration parameters and Kafka started almost first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't copy the script or dockerfile here as they're extremely similar to the Zookeeper versions. Instead, all scripts and files used above can be found in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ibebbs/Docker"&gt;Docker repository on Github&lt;/a&gt; and the resultant images can be found on &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ibebbs/"&gt;Docker hub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don't want any of that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I need to address a couple of short-comings in the Kafka script (specifically the hard-coded IP address for the Zookeeper container) and then look to use Docker Compose to automatically bring up Zookeeper and Kafka on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been an interesting journey so far and I've not even begun to actually use the deployed services yet! Still, it is truly magical to run a docker container and see it boot an entire Windows server and service in just 10-20 seconds and a few hundred Mb.&lt;/p&gt;
